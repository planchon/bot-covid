questions,answers
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients   may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These   symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t   develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the   disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19   becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying   medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to   develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical   attention."
How do I know if it is COVID-19 or just the common flu?,"A COVID-19 infection has the same signs and symptoms as the common cold and you can only   differentiate them through laboratory testing to determine the virus type. If you have fever, cough   and difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention and immediately isolate yourself from   others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant   travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local   Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical   assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through   contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How   does COVID-19 spread?”
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyone   Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website   and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world   have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some   other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is   unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:     Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them     with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based     hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.     Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or     sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from     their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the     droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.     Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up     viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From     there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.     Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means     covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.     Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following     good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu     and COVID-19.     Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek     medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.     Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the     situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly     direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of     viruses and other infections.     Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is     spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older     person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching     COVID-19 in one of these areas."
I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask?,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of masks in the community."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus- 2019/situation-reports/"
Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the       fetus?,"We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDC’s current Risk Assessment page."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself from catching the COVID-19 virus?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information."
Until when should I wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory       symptoms?,"In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having no symptoms without medication)."
I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What       precautions should I take?,"You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and           minimize shared space.           Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to           do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet           surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and           then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium           hypochlorite.           Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and           water (if hands are visibly soiled).           Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a           distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person.           When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask           that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual.           Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it           should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and           perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately           after use.           Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after           contact with respiratory secretions."
How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1- 14 days, most commonly around five days."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
How can I get tested for COVID-19?,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available?,"Can I use other       alcohol like ethyl or liquor? If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%."
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19."
Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature?,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with COVID-19. At this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer."
"Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close       proximity to someone who doesn’t have respiratory symptoms?","Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation."
Should I start avoiding people of Asian descent and their businesses?,"The virus can affect anyone regardless of nationality, race and color. The Organization will not tolerate discrimination and encourages everyone to promote culturally appropriate and empathetic community engagement and to detect and rapidly respond to negative public perceptions and counter misinformation."
"When should we identify ourselves as ""being sick"" and stay at home?","Although a fever is a sure sign that you are sick enough not to come to work, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing should stay at home."
My colleague is sick but he/she insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant      to work from home. What steps can we take to enforce “staying at home when not      well” amongst staff?,"While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the staff member is feeling unfit, he/she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would like to limit their contact with others and work from home."
What can we do if we don’t have any hand sanitizers in the office building?,"You should contact the Facilities Management Service of your local UN duty station, organization or the building administration."
What is the process for evaluating the criticality of official travels and meetings?,UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19.
Does the UN have any specific guidelines for meeting / mass gathering organizers and      participants during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"     For meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Division of Healthcare Management and      Occupational Safety and Health (DHMOSH) has prepared the following guidelines for      meeting organizers and participants which are available in the UN HR portal. UN offices      should use these global guidelines to develop local ones in accordance with host country      legislation.      The WHO has also released an interim guidance with key planning recommendations for      mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak."
I plan to travel to / have a meeting in countries or territories currently experiencing      local transmission of COVID-19. Should I cancel this travel/meeting?,"     While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel      restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational      health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN      personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel      balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas      experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical      issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties.     Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health     screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are     planning to travel should check with the destination countries’ embassy, consulate, or     Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your     travel. You should also comply with any screening measures put in place by local authorities.     As the outbreak evolves, it can be difficult to predict the situation globally, and it would be     prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise. Feel free to consult us     further at dos-dhmosh-public-health@un.org as needed."
"What is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting COVID-19     affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)?","    If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel.     During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any     signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.     Remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make     every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical     mask when you seek medical care.     You should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms.     HR personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to     support staff."
I just returned from travel to a country/area experiencing local transmission of     COVID-19. I am well and have no symptoms. Can I go back to the workplace?,"    For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or     territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise     flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who     would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel.     This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.     Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health     advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the     disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g.,     breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of     any symptoms within yourself. You should monitor yourself for at least 14 days after your     travel."
What about self-quarantining after returning from an area/country of high     prevalence?,"    If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel. During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention     should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.     Self-quarantine for 14 days is recommended when you have been exposed to contact with     lab-confirmed COVID-19.     Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, many member states are imposing quarantine     recommendations for travelers, which varies by country. We suggest monitoring the travel     advisories issued from WHO and DHMOSH for up to date information     https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice and     https://hr.un.org/page/travel-health-information"
Have medical insurance related questions?,Please refer to Frequently Asked Questions for UN staff on Medical Insurance in connection with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020- 03-09_faq_medical_insurance_covid-19_ra.pdf
What are the latest protocols and guidance for Medical Evacuation of staff members     with severe respiratory infections related to COVID-19?,"     For the latest information on normal Medevac procedure for staff, go to:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/Coronavirus_MedevacGuidance_UN_RC_0.pdf          For information on special Medevac procedure organized by the WHO in cases where          there are no ICU beds available in your country, see:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/COVID-          MEDEVAC%20UN%20and%20PARTNERS.pdf"
What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans."
How does the virus spread?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
"Can I get COVID-19 from food (including restaurant take-out, produce, refrigerated, or packaged food) or drinking water?","Currently there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 by eating or handling food. It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, such as a food package or dining ware that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. There is also no current evidence that people can get COVID-19 by drinking water. The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or kill the virus that causes COVID-19.​"
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​"
Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information."
How can I protect myself?,"Visit the How to Protect Yourself & Others page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19."
Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?,"Wear masks in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. The masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. More information about masks can be found on our masks site. How to Wear How to Wash How to Make"
Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?,"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you. Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date. Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if you get sick. to find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other conditions. Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any health condition that requires immediate attention. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition. Continue to practice everyday prevention. Wash your hands often, avoid close contact, wear a mask, cover coughs and sneezes, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces often. For more information, see Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness."
"Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Learn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail."
Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time."
Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?,"Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers. Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses. People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional. Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself. Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care."
Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?,"Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus. Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present. Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected. Find more information about how coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself. Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care."
Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?,"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection."
What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick?,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including: Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person. However, some people may need emergency medical attention. Watch for symptoms and learn when to seek emergency medical attention. When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19."
What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature and follow CDC guidance if you have symptoms."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C."
How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, like tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles). You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at How to Protect Yourself & Others. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads. More information on Keeping Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak is available online."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems. CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Learn more about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)."
Should children wear masks?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth in public settings when around people not living in your household, particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Masks should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance."
How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. When you talk with your child, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. Talk to your children about COVID-19 and help them cope with stress."
What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and who is at risk?,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care. Contact your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away if your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C. Seek emergency care right away if your child is showing any of these emergency warning signs of MIS-C or other concerning signs."
Can my child hang out with their friends?,"The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. Some children with certain underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk. For more information, see Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children."
How can I help my child continue learning?,"Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Look for ways to make learning fun. For more information, see Help Children Learn at Home."
Will kids have access to school meals?,Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
How can I keep my children healthy?,"Watch your child for any signs of illness. Watch for signs of stress in your child. Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions. Help your child stay active. Help your child stay socially connected. For more information, see Keep Children Healthy during the COVID-19 Outbreak."
"Limit time with older adults, including relatives, and people with chronic medical conditions.","Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19. If others in your home are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people. If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals and someone at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people. Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail."
Is my child with an underlying medical condition at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?,"It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed. Learn more about caring for children with special health care needs during a disaster and people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
What additional steps should families that have a child with an underlying medical condition take?,"In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness. Identify potential alternative caregivers, if you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers would not be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 themselves. Try to have at least one month of medication and medical supplies on hand. Some health plans allow for a 90-day supply of prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your child’s healthcare provider. Review any care plans for your child, such as an asthma action plan, and make sure caregivers and backup caregivers are familiar with these plans. If you do not have care plans or an emergency notebook, try to make them. They typically include important information about your child’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to get in touch with your child’s doctors, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other) or special needs, daily routines and activities, friends, and details about routines that are important to support behavioral and emotional health. Learn if your child’s healthcare providers, including doctors and therapists, have new ways to be contacted or new ways of providing appointments. If they offer telemedicine visits, find out how those are arranged and any additional information you need. If your child receives any support care services in the home that need to be continued, make plans for what you will do if those direct care providers get sick, or if persons in your household are sick. Discuss with the support care agencies and the providers ways to minimize risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. If your child or other persons in your household are sick with COVID-19 and are able to recover at home, inform your direct care providers and consider postponing or rescheduling services until the criteria for discontinuing home isolation have been met. Ask service providers if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Tell the service provider to: Wear a mask if they will be close (less than 6 feet) to you or persons in your household. Their mask helps protect you if they are infected but do not have symptoms. Ask them to wash their hands with soap and water or, if unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when they enter your home, before and after helping your child (dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting and/or diapering, feeding), after handling tissues, and after changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing. Service providers and families should: Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards, and other assistive devices. Refer to CDC’s recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home."
What can I do if my child has difficulties adjusting to new routines and following recommendations?,"Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing masks, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs. Keeping children at home can lower stress created by social distancing and mask recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands. Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations. Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19. Your child’s therapist(s) and teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child. While learning at home, continue special education services, accommodations, or services received in school through your child’s 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), as much as possible. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. Learn more about supporting children with distance learning. Additional information on caring for children and on child development specific conditions are available."
How can my family cope with the added stress?,"Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past. See information on helping children cope and coping with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger. If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others: Call 911 Visit the Disaster Distress Helplineexternal icon, call 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746 Visit the National Domestic Violence Hotlineexternal icon or call 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224"
What if my child or someone else in the home is sick with symptoms of COVID-19?,"If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others. Notify your child’s healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child. See additional information if someone in the home is sick with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19."
"What if my child’s symptoms of their underlying medical condition or complex, chronic medical condition get worse?","Call your child’s healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your child’s medical conditions. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you and your child from getting COVID-19 if your child needs care for medical conditions not related to COVID-19. Do not delay getting emergency care for your child’s underlying condition or complex medical condition because you are afraid of getting exposed to COVID-19 when visiting the healthcare setting."
What if my child needs to go to the hospital?,"If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19 Ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share important information about caring for your child. Visiting policies may have changed due to COVID-19. If your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be present. Bring your care plans/emergency notebook with you along with paper and pen to write down questions you have during your time at the hospital."
How can I prepare for an outbreak in my area?,"Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community: Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community. Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications. Make sure they have access to 2 weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time. Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected. Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources. Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources."
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19."
Should I make my own hand sanitizer if I can’t find it in the stores?,"CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidance.pdf iconexternal icon Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available. To be effective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy. Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices. Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. See CDC’s information for cleaning and sanitizing your home."
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19."
When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19?,"Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19."
Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time?,Yes. It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time.
Should I be tested for a current infection?,"Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested. CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing."
How can I get tested for a current infection (viral test) and what does my test mean?,"Decisions about testing are made by state and localexternal icon health departments or healthcare providers. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and are not tested, it is important to stay home. What to do if you are sick. COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized viral tests that let you collect either a nasal swabexternal icon or a saliva sampleexternal icon at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis. If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone. If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. For more information about viral tests, please visit Test for Current Infection."
How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean?,"Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again. If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others. If you want more information about antibody tests, see Test for Past Infection."
Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?,"Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. See Testing for Current Infection for more information."
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"If you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you should: Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible. Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others. If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible. If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks. Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms. Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines. Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency departments have contingency infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care."
Are people with disabilities at higher risk?,"Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition. People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed."
What is contact tracing?,"Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 During contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information Credit card numbers"
What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?,"Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department. You may also be interested in: If I participate contact tracing for COVID-19 using a digital tool, is my personal health information secure?"
Who is considered a close contact to someone with COVID-19?,"For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person had any symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19."
Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask?,"Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case you are infected, and not to protect you from becoming infected."
"If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19?","If you have been around someone who is sick with COVID-19, local authorities, the health department, or your doctor may recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area. While you are waiting for your COVID-19 test result, stay home away from others (self-quarantine) and monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19 to protect your friends, family, and others from possibly getting COVID-19. If your test is positive, you should continue to stay home and self-isolate away from others and monitor your health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and they worsen or become severe, you should seek emergency medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Someone from the health department may call you to Check on your health, Discuss who you have been around, and Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. If your test is negative and you don’t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you’ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work. If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve."
What will happen during contact tracing if I am diagnosed with COVID-19?,"If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to check on your health, discuss who you have been around, and ask where you spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. You will also be asked to continue to stay at home and self-isolate, away from others. Your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department staff will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information, or Credit card numbers Self-isolation means staying at home in a specific room away from other people and pets, and using a separate bathroom, if possible. Self-isolation helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and can help protect the health of your family, friends, neighbors, and others you may come in contact. If you need support or assistance while in self-isolation, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. Watch for or monitor your symptoms of COVID-19. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care."
What will happen during contact tracing if I have been around someone with COVID-19?,"If you were around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to let you know that you may have been exposed to COVID-19. Stay home away from others for 14 days (self-quarantine) after your last contact with that person. Health department staff will help identify the dates for your self-quarantine. Health department staff can also provide resources for COVID-19 testing in your area. Self-quarantine means staying home away from others and monitoring your health. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. This will help protect the people around you. If you need support or assistance while in self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. Monitor your health and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Remember, symptoms may appear 2-14 days after you were exposed to COVID-19. Tell the health department if you develop any symptoms. Tell people you were around recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. The health department staff will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information, or Credit card numbers"
"I was around someone who has COVID-19, and my COVID-19 test came back negative. Do I still need to quarantine for 14 days after I was last exposed?","Yes. You should still self-quarantine for 14 days since your last exposure. It can take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus for a person to develop COVID-19 symptoms. A negative result before end of the 14-day quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. By self-quarantining for 14 days, you lower the chance of possibly exposing others to COVID-19."
"I was recently around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel fine. Why should I stay at home?","People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the fight against COVID-19 and helps protect you, your family, and your community."
What if I have been around someone who was identified as a close contact?,"If you have been around someone who was identified as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, closely monitor yourself for any symptoms of COVID-19. You do not need to self-quarantine unless you develop symptoms or if the person identified as a close contact develops COVID-19."
Will there be a national app for contact tracing?,"No, there will not be a national app for contact tracing. There are many options available now, and it is up to each state and individual to decide which tools best fit their needs."
"If I participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 using a digital tool, is my personal health information secure?","Yes, if you agree to participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 with the health department, your information is secure. Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. Your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Health departments may use case management tools to help make the contact tracing process more efficient. If you choose to provide information through one of these tools, your information is secure and stored with the health department. These tools also help health departments quickly receive and analyze information about COVID-19. Case management tools are under the same laws and regulations for all sensitive health information use (e.g. HIPPA). You must provide consent for the health department to collect information using a case management tool. Just like traditional contact tracing, digital tools will not collect information regarding money, Social Security numbers, bank account information, salary information, or credit card numbers. Exposure notification tools may be an app that you can download on your personal cell phone. If you choose to download an exposure notification app for COVID-19, your information is secure. Exposure notification apps are developed in collaboration with or endorsed by health departments. These apps undergo rigorous testing to determine their trustworthiness, security, and ability to protect people’s privacy. Until you give consent to share information with your local health department, any information you have entered into the app is stored only on your personal phone. Your information is stored only on your own phone and is not sent to the health department or any other third party. The app and your information can be deleted any time. When you consent to share your information with the local health department, your information is secure."
Will I be required to download a contact tracing app for COVID-19 on my phone?,"No, you are not required to download an app to give information for contact tracing for COVID-19. Health departments commonly use case management tools to make the contact tracing process more efficient. These types of tools are not downloaded on personal cell phones. If you choose to give information to your local or state health department for contact tracing for COVID-19, you do not need to download an app on your cell phone. The health department staff may call you to Check on your health, Discuss who you have been around, and Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. It is up to you to decide if you download an exposure notification app for COVID-19."
Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?,"There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. See How to Protect Yourself & Others to learn how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19, if you decide to attend a funeral or visitation."
Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, face shield, or goggles and N-95 respirator)."
How can loved ones safely handle belongings of someone who died from COVID-19?,"If desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility. You should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones’ belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items."
What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas?,"When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance."
My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States?,"CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease. At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions: The remains are cremated; OR The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a leak-proof container; OR The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment. Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov. Please see CDC’s guidance for additional information."
What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?,"Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection."
"Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present?","The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. In order to reduce the need for cleaning, disinfection, and vacuuming, consider removing area rugs completely, if possible. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. For soft (porous) surfaces, such as carpeted floors or rugs, clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces, according to the textile’s label. After cleaning, disinfect with an appropriate EPA-registered disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon. Soft and porous materials, like carpet, are generally not as easy to disinfect as hard and non-porous surfaces. EPA has listed a limited number of products approved for disinfection for use on soft and porous materials on List N. Follow the disinfectant manufacturer’s safety instructions (such as wearing gloves and ensuring adequate ventilation), concentration level, application method and contact time. Allow sufficient drying time if vacuum is not intended for wet surfaces. Temporarily turn off in-room, window-mounted, or on-wall recirculation HVAC to avoid contamination of the HVAC units. Do NOT deactivate central HVAC systems. These systems tend to provide better filtration capabilities and introduce outdoor air into the areas that they serve."
What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19?,"Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning removes dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface."
Is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces."
Who should clean and disinfect community spaces?,Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used.
How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work?,"Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed."
"How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light?","The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19."
"Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19?","Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended."
Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19?,"CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage."
Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19?,CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces.
Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?,"At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website."
Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended."
Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them."
Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including Petting Snuggling Being kissed or licked Sharing food or bedding If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a mask."
What animals can get COVID-19?,"We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19."
Should I worry about my pet cat?,"We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."
Can I walk my dog during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Walking your dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk. See “Can I take my dog to a dog park?” for information on dog parks."
Can I take my dog to a dog park?,"Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather. Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park. Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea. If your dog has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities. Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park. As much as possible, avoid touching common items in the dog park like water bowls. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after touching items from the park. To make sure your dog has fresh water, consider bringing your own portable water bowl. Limit other pet items brought to the dog park, such as toys. Clean and disinfect anything taken to the park and returned home (leashes, toys, water bowls). Do not wipe or bathe your dog with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe."
Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer?,"Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather. Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible. Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. Do not put masks on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include: Fever Coughing Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Lethargy Sneezing Nasal/ocular discharge Vomiting Diarrhea If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. See more information on pets and COVID-19 and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe."
What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19?,"There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets. If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care."
Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested?,"Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed."
Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt?,"Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19."
What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility?,"Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19. Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19. Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept indoors to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people outside of the facility. Talk to a veterinarian if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. If you think a pet in the facility was exposed to or is showing signs consistent with COVID-19, contact your state health official to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19. People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible. For more information, visit CDC’s If You Have Pets webpage."
What about imported animals or animal products?,"CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulateexternal icon animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulatesexternal icon importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources."
Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak?,Please refer to CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States. The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.
"What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)?","Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available."
Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets?,"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus. If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States: Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead."
"Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread it back to people?","Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19."
Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations: Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead. Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal. Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal. When handling and cleaning game: Wear rubber or disposable gloves. Do not eat, drink, or smoke. When finished handling and cleaning game: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virusexternal icon. Cook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165°F or higher). Check with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat."
How can I safely run my equestrian facility?,"You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility. Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs for more information. Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home. Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas. Visitors and employees should wear masks to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a mask does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing. Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against theexternal icon virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. Follow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. If traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities. People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a mask to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water. If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.

What is community mitigation?,"Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, and prepare for it if it occurs, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available. For more information, see Community Mitigation Framework."
What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19?,"For individuals Washing hands often Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing social distancing Covering mouth and nose with a mask when around others Covering coughs and sneezes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily For communities Promoting behaviors that prevent spread Maintaining healthy environments Maintaining healthy operations Preparing for when someone gets sick Closing businesses and schools and limiting other services For more information, see Community Mitigation Framework."
Who is involved in community mitigation actions?,"Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances. For more information, see Community Mitigation Framework."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink. Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. You can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual."
Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low."
Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities. See Information for Wastewater and Sanitation System Workers on COVID-19 for additional information."
"If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands?","In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds?","CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Plus, proper operation of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public pool, hot tub, or water playground is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus: Stay home if you are infected or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Stay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don’t live with. Wear cloth masks when not in water. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. See Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds for more information."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools?,"CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation of public pools (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools. In traditional pools, chlorine products (such as granules or liquid bleach) are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt (made up of sodium and chloride) is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in lakes, oceans, or rivers?","CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers, or other natural bodies of water. The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public beach or other swim area in a natural body of water is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus: Stay home if you are infected or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Stay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don’t live with. Wear cloth masks when not in water. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. See Considerations for Public Beaches for more information. RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater, which can come from combined sewer overflowsexternal icon (rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater) and other sourcesexternal icon (such as, leaking septic tanks or animal waste from farms nearby) and enter swim areas. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person. At lakes, oceans, and rivers with routine water quality monitoring programs, staff look for changes in fecal (poop) contamination of the water. Water quality advisories and beach closures alert the public to avoid getting in or on the water because of increased fecal contamination. Learn more about healthy swimming in natural bodies of water and access water quality information by state."
Can cloth masks be worn in the water?,"No, do NOT wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be difficult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to stay at least 6 feet apart in the water from people you don’t live with. In case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second (or extra) cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public pool or beach."
"Can Lycra (Spandex or elastane), the cloth used to make swimsuits, be used to make cloth masks?","CDC does not yet have evidence on the effectiveness of different types of cloth materials. Wearing cloth masks can help prevent people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading the virus. Make sure your cloth mask: fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, completely covers the nose and mouth, is secured with ties or ear loops, includes multiple layers of fabric, allows for breathing without restriction, and can be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape. Cloth masks should NOT be worn by children less than 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Learn more about how to wear, take off, and wash your cloth masks."
"How many people, visitors and staff, can be in and around a public pool, hot tub, or water playground (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) at the same time?","The design of the public pool, hot tub, or water playground and surrounding deck and if visitors live together or not will affect how many people can stay at least 6 feet apart from those they don’t live with. CDC recommends operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds: comply with local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal regulatory agency policies and requirements on gathering (so the number of swimmers in the water isn’t more than the maximum allowed) and teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing among visitors and staff. Operators might want to limit the number of people in and around the water so if the water needs to be evacuated (because of lightning or other health or safety threat) social distancing can be maintained on the deck. Otherwise, if the water is evacuated and social distancing cannot be maintained on the deck, close the deck to visitors. There is no standard formula to determine how many people can maintain social distancing in the water and on the surrounding deck. See Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds for more information."
"Can I use pool, hot tub, or water playground water to disinfect surfaces or shared objects?","No. Only List N disinfectants approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon should be used to disinfect surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles). The list includes hundreds of disinfectants. Operators of public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) should consult with the design company or engineer to determine which disinfectants are best suited for surfaces and with manufacturers to determine which disinfectants are best suited for shared objects. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants."
Can the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light disinfect surfaces and shared objects?,"We don’t know yet. Early scientific data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun’s UV light. However, the ability of the sun’s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles) needs more research. Factors — such as cloudiness, latitude (distance from equator), time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun’s UV light — will determine how effectively the virus is inactivated. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectantsexternal icon."
"How often do surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) at public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to be cleaned and disinfected?","The more frequently a surface is touched by multiple people, the more frequently it should be cleaned and then disinfected with a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants."
"Do procedures for responding to formed fecal (poop) or diarrheal incidents in public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to change during the COVID-19 pandemic?","No. RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in feces (poop). While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in feces. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person. As a result, CDC has not changed its fecal incident response recommendations. Remember, do NOT vacuum feces out of the water."
"Can lifeguards monitor how visitors socially distance (stay at least 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with), wear cloth masks, or wash hands?","Not when lifeguards are actively lifeguarding. Lifeguards actively lifeguarding should not be doing other tasks that could distract them. Drowning deaths have resulted, at least in part, from lifeguards being distracted. Drowning can occur quickly and quietly. Learn and take steps to prevent drowning."
How can the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 be slowed during lifeguard training?,"Lifeguard trainers can consider the following steps to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19: Have the virus? Stay home to save lives. Educate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate (if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19) or quarantine (if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19) and when they can return or reschedule training. Conduct daily health checks (see frequently asked question on screening) or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks (such as temperature screening or symptom checking), if possible. Conduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and confidentiality laws, rules, and regulations. Be smart, stay at least 6 feet apart Conduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others. Teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing during in-person skills training in and out of the water — maintaining at least 6 feet between people who don’t live together. Provide physical cues or guides (such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck) and visual cues (such as posted signs or tape on the deck). Limit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who don’t live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such as Aquatic rescue For practice rescues Have each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student. For actual rescues Stress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care. Stress the need to 1) perform rescues from the deck (using an extending or throwing device) if conditions allow and 2) if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer’s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) For practice resuscitation Limit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin. For actual resuscitation Stress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Crossexternal icon), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers. Wear a mask. Save lives. Teach and reinforce use of cloth masks in public settings when around people you don’t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing. Advise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they’re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. Cover coughs and sneezes Teach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash hands often Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available. Clean and then disinfect Clean and then disinfect surfaces frequently touched by multiple people (such as door handles, light switches, and tables). Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon as per label instructions. Clean and then disinfect all shared equipment that is not disposable (such as manikins and rescue tubes) between users. Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon as per label instructions. Consult with manufacturers to decide which List N disinfectants are best for equipment. CDC has more COVID-19–related considerations for public pools and public beaches and non-COVID-19–related healthy and safe swimming resources."
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
what is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses. They are called coronaviruses because the virus particle exhibits a characteristic ‘corona’ (crown) of spike proteins around its lipid envelope. CoV infections are common in animals and humans. Some strains of CoV are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between animals and humans, but many strains are not zoonotic.

In humans, CoV can cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (caused by MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV). Detailed investigations have demonstrated that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civets to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.

In December 2019, human cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China (People’s Rep. of). A new CoV was identified as the causative agent by Chinese Authorities. Since then, human cases have been reported by almost all countries around the world and the COVID-19 event has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a pandemic. For up to date information please consult the WHO website.

The CoV which causes COVID-19 has been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV); this is the scientific name. The virus may also be referred to as “the COVID-19 virus” or “the virus responsible for COVID-19”. COVID19 refers to the disease caused by the virus."
what are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
what can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.
"
Should I worry about COVID-19?," Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.
Learn more about how to protect yourself at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public
"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Is there a vaccin, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus).
"
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003"
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.
WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  (see Advice on the use of masks).
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information"
"How to put on, use,take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
How long is the incubation perod for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  
To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. 
WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
Is it safe to receive a packae from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. "
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:
Smoking
Wearing multiple masks
Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")
In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occcur?,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.
However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.
Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing."
Is COVID-19 airborne?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. 
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
I got my flu shot this year. Can it help me warding off or dealing with COVID-19?,"The flu vaccine is a very good thing to get every year because it helps reduce the chances of getting the seasonal flu. However, the flu shot does not confer any protection against COVID-19. Despite similar symptoms, the flu shot will not prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19."
What’s important to know is that getting a flu shot will have the indirect effect of helping with our health care system’s COVID-19 response?,"If we reduce the likelihood of seasonal flu and patients needing to be seen in clinics and hospitals, our health care workers will be able to focus their efforts on increasing capacity while treating the surge of COVID-19 patients they are seeing."
Is there a vaccine for coronavirus?,"Developing new vaccines takes time and they must be rigorously tested and confirmed safe via clinical trials before they can be routinely used in humans. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, has commonly stated a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away. Experts agree there's a ways to go yet.   
However, there is great progress being made in this regard and a number of vaccine candidates have appeared in the time since COVID-19 was discovered. We've collated everything we know about potential vaccines and current treatment options that are being used around the world.
In developing a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, scientists are looking at the spike proteins intensely. These proteins, which are present on the surface of the virus, enable it to enter human cells where it can replicate and make copies of itself. Researchers have been able to map the projections in 3D and research suggests they could be a viable antigen -- a fragment that stimulates the human body's immune system -- in any potential coronavirus vaccine. 
The protein is prevalent in coronaviruses we've battled in the past, too -- including the one that caused the SARS outbreak in China in 2002-2003. This has given researchers a head start on building vaccines against part of the spike protein and, using animal models, they have already demonstrated an immune response.
Notably, SARS, which infected around 8,000 people and killed around 800, seemed to run its course and then mostly disappear. It wasn't a vaccine that turned the tide on the disease but rather effective communication between nations and a range of tools that helped track the disease and its spread. 
""We learnt that epidemics can be controlled without drugs or vaccines, using enhanced surveillance, case isolation, contact tracking, PPE and infection control measures,"" MacIntyre said."
Do people develop immunity?,"Vaccines help a person to generate an immune response against an infection without first being exposed to the pathogen. Studies of other coronaviruses, such as the four that cause some common colds, lead most researchers to assume that people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection will be protected from reinfection for a period of time. But that assumption needs to be backed by evidence, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. “We don’t know that much about immunity to this virus.”A preprint1 posted online on 14 March by a team based in China looked at two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which caused them only mild illness. The monkeys did not seem to become re-infected when researchers exposed them to the virus for a second time four weeks after their initial exposure. Researchers will be looking for evidence that humans react in the same way, for instance by studying people potentially exposed multiple times, Diamond says."
"If humans do develop immunity, how long does it last?","That’s another big unknown. Immunity is short-lived for the coronaviruses that cause common colds; even people who have high levels of antibodies against these viruses can still become infected, says Stanley Perlman, a coronavirologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

The evidence is more equivocal for the two other coronaviruses that have triggered epidemics: those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Perlman says his team has found that after people recover from MERS, their antibodies against the virus drop precipitously. He also says that his team has gathered data — not yet published — showing that SARS antibodies are still present in the body 15 years after infection. But it’s not clear whether this immune response is enough to prevent reinfection. “We don’t have good evidence of long-lasting immunity, but we also don’t have really good data from both SARS and MERS,” Perlman adds."
What kind of immune response should vaccine developers look for?,"The phase I trial that began this week focuses on the safety of a vaccine developed by Moderna, a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But researchers will also look closely at the nature of the immune response the vaccine summons.

The Moderna vaccine consists of an RNA molecule. Like many of the other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, it is designed to train the immune system to make antibodies that recognize and block the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells.

“I think it’s reasonable as a first pass, but we will learn that, perhaps, antibody responses to the spike exclusively may not be the whole story,” says Diamond. A successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine might need to prompt the body to generate antibodies that block other viral proteins, for instance, or make T cells that can recognize and kill infected cells."
How do we know if a vaccine is likely to work?,"Normally, vaccines go into human trials after tests for safety and effectiveness in animals. But the Moderna vaccine and another being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, are being tested in animals at the same time as human phase I trials are happening. Inovio plans to begin its first human trial in April.

“In a non-emergency situation you might do this in a more serial way, but in this case a lot of things are being done in parallel,” says Barney Graham, deputy-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland, which is sponsoring the Moderna vaccine trial.

In a 2 March preprint2, researchers reported injecting Inovio’s vaccine — a DNA molecule carrying instructions to make the spike protein — into mice and guinea pigs. They found that the animals produced both antibodies and T cells against the virus. Study leader Kate Broderick, Inovio’s senior vice-president for preclinical research and development, says that her team has now given the vaccine to monkeys and is soon to start studies in which vaccinated animals are infected with the virus to see whether they are protected. Such ‘challenge’ studies are also in the works for the Moderna vaccine, says Graham.

He adds that large, costly trials of whether a vaccine can prevent infections in people won’t proceed without such data from animals. Diamond expects that as researchers learn more about the infection from both human and animal studies, they will get a better sense of which vaccines are likely to work best. “It may not be the most efficient way to do it. But it may be the most expedient way to generate a vaccine,” says Diamond."
Will it be safe?,"Because they are given to large numbers of healthy people, vaccines usually have a higher bar for safety than do drugs administered to people who are already ill. With SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, researchers’ main safety concern is to avoid a phenomenon called disease enhancement, in which vaccinated people who do get infected develop a more severe form of the disease than people who have never been vaccinated. In studies of an experimental SARS vaccine reported3 in 2004, vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their livers after being infected with the virus.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, thinks potential vaccines should be tested in animals first to rule out disease enhancement, before trials move on to humans. He says he understands the reasoning for pushing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to human tests quickly, but adds that, because of the possibility that a vaccine could enhance disease, “I’m not sure this is the vaccine you want to do it for”.

In testing the Moderna vaccine, Graham says, the NIH will move to larger human studies only once human and animal studies confirm that the vaccine is safe. He says the risk of enhancement is low, but “the risk of not getting vaccines advanced quickly — so that we can have something available for the next winter season to at least test in the field — that risk is fairly high”."
Can employees be restricted from traveling to impacted countries?,"At this point, there have been numerous countries around the world impacted by the coronavirus. While employers can limit business travel or cancel company events, employees who plan to travel for personal reasons cannot be restricted from doing so. That said, as an employer, you may ask employees to notify you prior to any overseas travel. Furthermore, you may be able to take additional steps to ensure the safety of everyone who is employed at your facility, such as implementing a work-from-home policy or other limited staffing plan."
Can I legally restrict visitors to the workplace amid coronavirus concerns?,"While you likely have the right to insist that anyone who has a fever or flu symptoms not visit your work facilities, it is advisable to ensure that any such policy is applied uniformly across all demographic groups. This includes contractors, vendors and visitors. A posted policy should be visible to anyone entering your facility. You may wish to consider a hand-held temperature-screening device, provided the use of such a device is legal in your state. A local lawyer can help you determine what is legal and appropriate in your specific situation."
Does FMLA apply to employees who need to take off due to coronavirus illness?,"If the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) guidelines apply to your business, employees may have leave benefits available to them. The reason the coronavirus likely qualifies is that it is classified as a “serious health condition.” Keep in mind, this may also apply if the employee requires time off to care for an immediate family member.

It is important to note that there may also be state laws that apply, especially for those companies that aren’t subject to FMLA. A local attorney can explain which laws apply to your business."
Would my company be liable if an employee contracts coronavirus at work?,"Employees who contract coronavirus on the job, particularly healthcare workers, may be entitled to collect workers’ compensation. Because of this, employers may be responsible for covering medical bills associated with the disease if an employee becomes ill due to contact with someone in the workplace. You may need to ensure you have spoken with a medical professional to assist you in determining if there is a relationship between the job and the employee being stricken with the virus.Employees may also be entitled to disability payments if such benefits are part of your overall benefits plan. Make sure you have verified any limits on coverage and plan for any resources you may need to administer the program. Your insurance-plan provider may have additional guidance.

Lastly, employers should always seek to reduce potential tort claims by following commercially reasonable practices. For example, if a particular geographic area or industry is affected disproportionately by illness, employers may collectively take extraordinary measures. It’s probably not a good idea to be the outlier in that case."
Do I need to pay an employee who misses work due to being quarantined?,"Whether an employee must be paid during quarantine will depend, in large part, on the benefits that you offer in relation to sick leave and applicable law (like FMLA). If you have workers who are exempt and they show up for work during any given week and you send them home, you may still be required to pay them for the entire work week. Employees who have a specific number of sick days and/or personal days may also elect to use those benefits during a period they are quarantined.

This is a good time to review your current benefits offering and see how many employees have accumulated paid sick and personal leave time. Having this information can be helpful to ensure your business is not negatively impacted in the event numerous employees opt to take time off during a potential outbreak or threat to their health in the workplace.

It is also important to note that your state may have its own “sick leave” law that applies. An employment lawyer can help you determine if your policy meets the legal standards in your state."
How can I communicate my global health-emergency policy as an employer?,"Your company emergency policies should be clearly spelled out in your Employee Handbook. This can help ensure that employees at all levels understand what steps you believe will keep your workplace safe for everyone.

While your HR policies should ideally always be up-to-date, this is a great time to review all of the HR documents your company uses. It is always a good idea to work with a lawyer when drafting or revising human resources policy.

Ensuring that employees practice regular hand washing and that your facilities are properly cleaned may also help curb potential spreading of the virus. In order to help your team feel safe, keep hand sanitizer and disinfectant on hand, and ensure that your restrooms are stocked with the appropriate soap, towels and toiletries. Additional guidance for businesses and employers can be found through the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention."
Are there any tests that I can purchase to test myself at home for COVID-19?,"At this time, the FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers in this space. In the other FAQs on this page you can find listings of tests that have received an EUA authorization as well as labs and manufacturers that have notified FDA as set forth in the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019."

This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals.
Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
This policy does not apply to at home testing.

The commercial manufacturers and laboratories listed below have notified FDA that they have validated and are offering serology tests as set forth in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019.

"When FDA authorizes under an EUA a SARS-CoV-2 test for use at the point of care, does that mean it is CLIA waived?","Yes.  The settings in which an EUA-authorized test may be used are described in the Letter of Authorization.  As discussed in the Guidance for Industry and Other Stakeholders: Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities, when the FDA authorizes point of care tests (including SARS-CoV-2 point of care test systems) under an EUA, such tests are deemed to be CLIA waived tests.  Accordingly, for the duration of the emergency declaration, such tests can be performed in a patient care setting that is qualified to have the test performed there as a result of operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver or Certificate of Compliance.

We note that the term point of care in the EUAs may include settings such as hospitals, physician offices, urgent care, outreach clinics, and temporary patient care settings that have appropriately trained personnel to perform the test and are operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver or Certificate of Compliance. These terms generally do not apply to home specimen collection or at home testing unless otherwise specified. "
" When tests are offered prior to or without an EUA under the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, what is their CLIA categorization?","Tests being offered prior to or without an EUA under the policies outlined in the FDA's Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that have not yet been reviewed by the FDA, are not FDA authorized, and have not received a CLIA categorization.  While FDA has indicated that such tests may be appropriate for use in clinical laboratories and by healthcare workers at the point of care, the policies in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 do not provide a CLIA categorization and do not override any CLIA requirements.  Therefore, in accordance with CLIA, tests offered under these policies are considered high complexity by default until or unless they are authorized and deemed to be appropriate, through an EUA authorization or general FDA review processes, to be performed as moderate or waived complexity tests.
 
Laboratories using tests being marketed under the FDA’s EUA policy should be mindful of CLIA requirements which are enforced by CMS and certain State authorities, and CMS guidance for laboratories during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Under CMS guidance, if a facility has the appropriate CLIA certificates and follows applicable CLIA regulations, state regulations and guidelines, the laboratory’s CLIA certificate can be extended to cover testing in areas outside of the designated primary site or home base such as contiguous buildings, or any other designated temporary overflow location in its facility or temporary remote location, such as a parking lot."
I requested and received an EUA template prior to the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 which was accompanied by a posting on the web of the EUA template for clinical laboratories. The first version references testing 50 clinical specimens and the new version references testing 30 clinical specimens. Which is accurate?,"Due to the limited availability of reagents for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the growing need for testing suspected cases of the COVID-19, the FDA revised the EUA templates for both clinical laboratories and manufacturers with regard to EUA submissions for tests intended for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. As set forth in the guidance, the FDA recommends clinical evaluation should include 30 contrived clinical specimens."
Can I offer my test for home use and/or self-collection under the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019?,"As noted in the guidance, the policies outlined in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 do not apply to at-home testing, including self-collection of samples to be sent to a clinical laboratory.

FDA encourages developers to discuss their validation of home use and/or self-collection tests with us early in their development process."
Are two or more viral targets needed to validate an RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay?,"Based on evidence that has become recently available, and with the increased spread of COVID-19, FDA believes an appropriately validated single viral target SARS-CoV-2 assay could provide acceptable performance. Please refer to the policy outlined in Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, which includes recommendations regarding the minimum testing to be performed to ensure analytical and clinical validity for COVID-19 diagnostic assays, as well as the templates for EUA submissions provided on FDA's website."
I am developing a COVID-19 assay that is a modification of a previously EUA authorized COVID-19 assay. Do I need to start from scratch with my validation or can I validate my test with a bridging study?,"As discussed in the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, FDA does not intend to object to the use of a test, without a new or amended EUA, where the test is validated using a bridging study to an EUA-authorized test. One way to bridge to a new component is to establish equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components. We recommend testing 3-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral materials (e.g., whole genomic viral RNA or inactivated virus, etc.) in pooled respiratory sample matrix in triplicate.

As noted in the guidance, in these cases, while FDA does not intend to object where no EUA request is submitted, FDA would like to see your validation data informally through an email to CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV. If FDA's review of validation data indicates that it could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, and the laboratory agrees to FDA sharing that information on our website for use by other laboratories, FDA intends to update our FAQs so other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing, without conducting their own bridging study for the same modification.

The CDC has granted a right of reference to the performance data contained in the CDC's EUA request (FDA submission number EUA200001) to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device. Laboratories bridging to another EUA-authorized assay must obtain a right of reference to leverage the performance data for that EUA-authorized assay."
What are the current recommendations regarding minimum testing for demonstrating performance of a new COVID-19 assay?,"Please refer to Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019, where we have provided recommendations regarding the minimum testing to be performed to ensure analytical and clinical validity of these tests. We recommend consulting with us as soon as possible if you pursue a different approach to validation or to discuss any additional questions regarding performance and validation issues."
I am developing a SARS-CoV-2 test kit and want to pursue an EUA. Do I need to have all of my validation and documentation completed and submitted in an EUA request to FDA before engaging with the FDA?,"No. The FDA is interested in early interactions with test developers and will review data on a rolling basis. We encourage you to reach out to us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov to begin pre-EUA discussions, even if you do not have your validation and/or documentation completed. We can work with you on the best approach for completing your validation, documentation, and submission of your EUA request. Clinical laboratories certified to perform high-complexity testing under CLIA that are planning to test patient samples prior to completion of an EUA should refer to the Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019."
I am having trouble obtaining viral transport media/universal transport media (VTM/UTM) and a flocked nasopharyngeal swab to collect and transport patient samples. Are there alternatives that I can use?,"The alternative recommendations below are made in the context of limited quantities of testing supplies during this public health crisis, based on the best available evidence and in consultation with outside experts. We have included a list of examples of products, including catalog numbers for different distributors. The absence of a specific product from this list does not imply unacceptability of that product if it is of the correct type.

Do I need a test?,"It depends.

Despite President Trump saying last week that ""anyone who wants a test can get a test,"" officials say that getting everyone tested is a long-term goal. Currently, testing is limited and should be for those who really need it, public health officials told ABC News.

As of March 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) labs have tested some 3,900 specimens of the virus, while U.S. public health labs have tested over 12,000 specimens. More than 81 public health labs are online in all 50 states and are conducting testing, according to the CDC, with testing results still pending."
why test?,"Many COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the common cold and influenza, but only testing can confirm an infection. This is different, for instance, from China, which for a period of time included clinical diagnoses in its count in addition to lab-confirmed tests. Scientists told ABC News that changing that methodology could complicate tracking the disease.Public health officials told ABC News that testing is necessary mainly to track the spread of disease and ensure proper treatment and isolation for those infected, especially since COVID-19 is an influenza-like illness."
How does it work?,"On Friday, the White House announced a new testing protocol where prospective patients are directed to a screening website. If they have symptoms, they will be directed to a drive-thru testing site, like those in Denver and elsewhere. Those tests will be sent to labs for analysis, said Dr. Debbie Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.

But public health officials told ABC News that it is not like taking a pregnancy test or other common medical tests. Instead, it is more like the test for Ebola, they said, providing a set of data as opposed to a yes or no answer.

Under the current protocol, according to officials, test administered by hospitals or clinics typically involve:

-Two sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

-20 to 25 minutes to put on and take off PPE.

-Transporting the sample to the lab -- a process called real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)

-A certified epidemiologist confirms every positive test.

-Results are entered into the system.

Any test conducted on someone under quarantine requires even more resources and protection, the officials told ABC News.

Under the new protocol, using the drive-thru sites, ""the goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,"" President Trump said on March 13. The test uses a nasal swab, Birx said."
How long will the results take?,"It depends. Results had been taking a few days, but the new testing procedure would take 24 hours from start to finish, Birx said."
Can I test negative and later test positive?,"According to the CDC, yes.

Under the CDC-developed test, a negative result means the virus was not detected in the patient's sample, which is possible in the early stages of infection.

""For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness,"" the CDC said."
What if I test positive?,"As ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton and other medical experts have pointed out, there is no treatment for this virus.

All medical professionals can do for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is keep their body healthy to allow it to fight off the virus. Ventilators are used to assist in breathing in some cases and antibiotics are used to fight off secondary infections a patient may develop.

Experts also say it will take a year to 18 months to develop a vaccine because testing it in real-world environments and ensuring it works is time-consuming."
What are the new tests coming?,"Three labs, Everlywell, MicroGenDX and Nurx -- have made it possible to test for COVID-19 right from your living room.

Home kits allow patients to swab at home, send samples to a central lab and have results within days. However, swabs are in short supply, so many of these companies are expecting supply chain problems and are actively looking for workarounds.

All the at-home testing kits have to get shipped to a lab for results. The Everlywell and Nurx tests get results between 48 hours or ""within days"" while MicroGenDX's COVID-19 Rapid PCR Test has a 24-hour turnaround from time of receipt.

MicroGenDX will have the capacity to process over 8,000 samples per day beginning April 1 or sooner.

Traditional testing labs such as Hologic, LabCorp and Abbott -- are working to speed up their existing testing capacity.

Hologic has FDA approval to provide results for coronavirus tests in less than three hours and to process up to 1,150 tests in a 24-hour period.

LabCorp expects to perform 10,000 tests every day and by the end of the month conduct 20,000 per day.

Abbott is scaling up production at its U.S. manufacturing location to reach up to one million tests per week by end of March. Their m2000 RealTime testing system is currently available in hospitals and molecular laboratories and ships 150,000 laboratory tests immediately."
can COVID-19 be spread through bodily fluids such as blood sweat or semen?,"Current evidence suggests that there is no risk of contracting COVID-19 from bodily fluids (blood, sweat, semen). The virus is spread by respiratory droplets when a person who is infected coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 is most commonly spread by:

close contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze;
touching infected surfaces with your hands and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes."
Can COVID-19 be spread by contact with the faces of a person who is sick?,"The risk of contracting COVID-19 by contact with an infected person’s feces is low, but possible. This is why you must wash your hands regularly, especially after going to the bathroom and before eating."
Can a person who does not have symptoms spread COVID-19?,"The risk of getting COVID-19 if you have contact with someone who does not have any symptoms is low.

However, many people who are infected have only mild symptoms. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. For example, you can get COVID-19 if you have contact with someone who has only a mild cough but does not feel sick.

That’s why you are advised to keep at least 2 metres away from other people even if no one has symptoms."
Could the arrival of spring and the warmer weather affect the spread of COVID-19?,"It might, but so far COVID-19 has been found in many countries, whatever their climate. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer."
What is physical distancing? Is it really effective is slowing the spread of COVID-19?,"Physical distancing means keeping a certain distance from other people. Since COVID-19 is mainly spread by close contact with infected people, it is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of the disease. To minimize close contact with other people who are infected, you must:

Stay at home as much as possible;
Avoid non-essential gatherings with people who do not live in your household (for example, dinner with friends);
Avoid physical contact with people who are most at risk of complications (older adults, people with chronic diseases or a weakened immune system);
If you must go out, stay at least 2 metres (around 6 feet) away from other people as much as possible."
When should I wash my hands?,"As often as possible, but especially:

Before touching your face (eyes, mouth, nose);
After coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose;
After going to the bathroom;
When your hands are visibly dirty or after touching something dirty;
Before and after providing care to a family member or friend;
Before and after preparing meals;
Before and after eating;
Before and after going to a public place (for example, the grocery store or pharmacy)."
Is wearing a mask protect me effectively against COVID-19?,"Masks are not the best protective measure against infections such as COVID-19 for the general population in Québec. Their use is recommended for patients with a suspected infection. In this situation, when it is necessary to wear a mask, a procedure mask is used. It must be worn solely in the presence of other people or in a health-care setting. The mask enables infected individuals to protect the people around them by retaining potentially contaminated fine droplets that are discharged when they breathe or sneeze.

Because of the nature of their work, health professionals use the N95 mask, which protects them from viruses by filtering the air that they breathe."
Can I replace antiseptic gel with other products found in the home?,"Washing your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds is the best method. Antiseptic gel should be used when soap and water are unavailable. Acetone-based products such as nail polish remover or hydrogen peroxide, mainly sold in drugstores, are not designed to disinfect the hands and pose a health hazard"
Should I wear gloves to protect myself?,There is a shortage of medical gloves right now. They should be reserved for use by health professionals. Wearing gloves can give you a false sense of security. The best way to protect yourself is to wash your hands frequently and properly. Go to the page Washing your hands to find out how.
"Would it be a good idea to catch the virus so that I would be immunized afterwards,i.e.,to develop resistance to the virus?","No, it would be risky and the benefits are uncertain. There is a real risk, even for young people, of catching COVID-19 and being hospitalized or admitted to intensive care.

In addition, even if infected people develop antibodies against the virus, at this time it is impossible to know if this would provide a natural defence or effective, lasting immunity."
Are screening tests effective if you don’t have symptoms?,"At this time, it cannot be confirmed that tests done on people who are asymptomatic are conclusive, However, if a person has symptoms consistent with COVID‑19 and had close contact with a confirmed case, they can be considered to have COVID‑19 without doing a test."
Why isn’t everyone being tested?,"The coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic is evolving very rapidly. Whereas in January and February, COVID‑19 was spread by returning travellers, most cases are now caused by community transmission.

This means that testing priorities need to be revised. From now on, testing will focus on people who are most at risk of being hospitalized or developing complications due to the infection and on people who play a critical role in the fight against the infection in Québec.

This prioritization of testing will help maintain health services, first responder services and essential services by identifying symptomatic people who might be involved in outbreaks in their workplace and among people who are at risk."
"Are there any foods, supplements, vitamins or natural health products that can be used to prevent or treat COVID-19?","There are no foods, supplements, vitamins or natural health products that can be used to protect you against or treat COVID-19.

You cannot strengthen your immune system through diet.

However, for the immune system to function effectively, it is important to eat a variety of healthy foods every day, as recommended in Canada’s Food Guide. To find out more, go to the page Healthy eating."
Is it preferable to self-isolate and stay home in the coming weeks even if individuals are not returning from a trip?,"Confinement is one of the measures that will reduce the spread of COVID-19. Elderly people 70 years of age and over and those with a weak immune system or suffering from chronic diseases are asked to stay home,except in the case of necessity or exceptional circumstances, for example for a medical appointment.

Visits to hospitals, residential and long-term care centres, intermediate resources, family-type resources and private seniors' homes are prohibited until further notice.

Healthy individuals are urged to avoid gatherings as much as possible, especially in enclosed spaces, and to follow basic health advice."
Should I be worried about the COVID-19 situation?,"For now, the spread of COVID-19 is under control in Québec, but the situation must be monitored closely. The Government is taking all the necessary measures to contain the contagion as much as possible."
Does the RAMQ cover health services provided by means of telecommunications?,"Yes, the RAMQ will from now on cover health services provided by correspondence or by means of telecommunications. This coverage includes, for example, a telephone consultation with a physician."
Can my pet catch COVID-19? Can I catch the disease from my pet?,"No cases of infected pets have been reported in Canada. At this time, there is no evidence that pets, such as cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19."
What is convalescent plasma? How could it help people with COVID-19?,"When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.

Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. In the current situation, antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length or reducing the severity of the disease.

Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. There have been reports of success from China, but no randomized, controlled studies (the gold standard for research studies) have been done. Experts also don't yet know the best time during the course of the illness to give plasma.

On March 24th, the FDA began allowing convalescent plasma to be used in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. This treatment is still considered experimental."
Who can donate plasma for COVID-19?,"In order to donate plasma, a person must meet several criteria. They have to have tested positive for COVID-19, recovered, have no symptoms for 14 days, currently test negative for COVID-19, and have high enough antibody levels in their plasma. A donor and patient must also have compatible blood types. Once plasma is donated, it is screened for other infectious diseases, such as HIV.

Each donor produces enough plasma to treat one to three patients. Donating plasma should not weaken the donor's immune system nor make the donor more susceptible to getting reinfected with the virus."
Should parents take babies for initial vaccines right now? What about toddlers and up who are due for vaccines?,"The answer depends on many factors, including what your doctor's office is offering. As with all health care decisions, it comes down to weighing risks and benefits.

Getting early immunizations in for babies and toddlers — especially babies 6 months and younger — has important benefits. It helps to protect them from infections such as pneumococcus and pertussis that can be deadly, at a time when their immune system is vulnerable. At the same time, they could be vulnerable to complications of COVID-19 should their trip to the doctor expose them to the virus.

For children older than 2 years, waiting is probably fine — in most cases. For some children with special conditions, or those who are behind on immunizations, waiting may not be a good idea.

The best thing to do is call your doctor's office. Find out what precautions they are taking to keep children safe, and discuss your particular situation, including not only your child's health situation, but also the prevalence of the virus in your community and whether you have been or might have been exposed. Together, you can make the best decision for your child."
When do you need to bring your child to the doctor during this pandemic?,"Anything that isn't urgent should be postponed until a safer time. This would include checkups for healthy children over 2 years (many practices are postponing checkups even for younger children if they are generally healthy). It would also include follow up appointments for anything that can wait, like a follow-up for ADHD in a child that is doing well socially and academically. Your doctor's office can give you guidance about what can wait — and when to reschedule. Many practices are offering phone or telemedicine visits, and it's remarkable how many things can be addressed that way.

Some things, though, do require an in-person appointment, including:

Illness or injury that could be serious, such as a child with trouble breathing, significant pain, unusual sleepiness, a high fever that won't come down, or a cut that may need stitches or a bone that may be broken. Call your doctor for guidance as to whether you should bring your child to the office or a local emergency room.
Children who are receiving ongoing treatments for a serious medical condition such as cancer, kidney disease, or a rheumatologic disease. These might include chemotherapy, infusions of other medications, dialysis, or transfusions. Your doctor will advise you about any changes in treatments or how they are to be given during the pandemic. Do not skip any appointments unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Checkups and visits for children with certain health conditions. This might include children with breathing problems whose lungs need to be listened to, children who need vaccinations to protect their immune system, children whose blood pressure is too high, children who aren't gaining weight, children who need stitches out or a cast off, or children with abnormal blood tests that need rechecking. If your child is being followed for a medical problem, call your doctor for advice. Together you can figure out when and how your child should be seen.
Bottom line: Talk to your doctor. The decision will depend on a combination of factors including your child's condition, how prevalent the virus is in your community, whether you have had any exposures or possible exposures, what safeguards your doctor has put into place, and how you would get to the doctor."
Is the antiviral drug remdesivir effective for treating COVID-19?,"Scientists all over the world are testing whether drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections might also be effective against the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

One drug that has received a lot of attention is the antiviral drug remdesivir. That's because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the coronaviruses that caused the diseases SARS and MERS — and evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that remdesivir may help limit the reproduction and spread of these viruses in the body. In particular, there is a critical part of all three viruses that can be targeted by drugs. That critical part, which makes an important enzyme that the virus needs to reproduce, is virtually identical in all three coronaviruses; drugs like remdesivir that successfully hit that target in the viruses that cause SARS and MERS are likely to work against the COVID-19 virus.

Remdesivir was developed to treat several other severe viral diseases, including the disease caused by Ebola virus (not a coronavirus). It works by inhibiting the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce and make copies of itself: if it can't reproduce, it can't make copies that spread and infect other cells and other parts of the body.

Remdesivir inhibited the ability of the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS to infect cells in a laboratory dish. The drug also was effective in treating these coronaviruses in animals: there was a reduction in the amount of virus in the body, and also an improvement in lung disease caused by the virus.

The drug appears to be effective in the laboratory dish, in protecting cells against infection by the COVID virus (as is true of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses), but more studies are underway to confirm that this is true.

Remdesivir was used in the first case of COVID-19 that occurred in Washington state, in January 2020. The patient was severely ill, but survived. Of course, experience in one patient does not prove the drug is effective.

Two large randomized clinical trials are underway in China. The two trials will enroll over 700 patients, and are likely to definitively answer the question of whether the drug is effective in treating COVID-19. The results of those studies are expected in April or May 2020. Studies also are underway in the United States, including at several Harvard-affiliated hospitals. It is hard to predict when the drug could be approved for use and produced in large amounts, assuming the clinical trials indicate that it is effective and safe."
Is a lost sense of smell a symptom of COVID-19? What should I do if I lose my sense of smell?,"Increasing evidence suggests that a lost sense of smell, known medically as anosmia, may be a symptom of COVID-19. This is not surprising, because viral infections are a leading cause of loss of sense of smell, and COVID-19 is a caused by a virus. Still, loss of smell might help doctors identify people who do not have other symptoms, but who might be infected with the COVID-19 virus — and who might be unwittingly infecting others.

A statement written by a group of ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported that in Germany, two out of three confirmed COVID-19 cases had a loss of sense of smell; in South Korea, 30% of people with mild symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19 reported anosmia as their main symptom.

On March 22nd, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommended that anosmia be added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms used to screen people for possible testing or self-isolation.

In addition to COVID-19, loss of smell can also result from allergies as well as other viruses, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold. So anosmia alone does not mean you have COVID-19. Studies are being done to get more definitive answers about how common anosmia is in people with COVID-19, at what point after infection loss of smell occurs, and how to distinguish loss of smell caused by COVID-19 from loss of smell caused by allergies, other viruses, or other causes altogether.

Until we know more, tell your doctor right away if you find yourself newly unable to smell. He or she may prompt you to get tested and to self-isolate."
Do adults younger than 65 who are otherwise healthy need to worry about COVID-19?,"Yes, they do. Though people younger than 65 are much less likely to die from COVID-19, they can get sick enough from the disease to require hospitalization. According to a report published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in late March, nearly 40% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 between mid-February and mid-March were between the ages of 20 and 54. Drilling further down by age, MMWR reported that 20% of hospitalized patients and 12% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs were between the ages of 20 and 44.

People of any age should take preventive health measures like frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask when going out in public, to help protect themselves and to reduce the chances of spreading the infection to others."
Should I wear a face mask?,"The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public.

Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in.

A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly.

While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.

Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask.

Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.

Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing.

The CDC has information on how to make, wear, and clean nonsurgical masks.

The WHO offers videos and illustrations on when and how to use a mask."
I have symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or I have COVID-19. What can I do to take care of myself?,"If you have symptoms of coronavirus disease, you will feel tired and weak. Rest will help you fight the disease. Limit your contact with other people until the symptoms have resolved. You can resume your activities when your condition allows.

It is important to drink often because fever makes you sweat and lose a lot of fluids. At least 1.5 litres of fluids per day is recommended. Have hot or cold or drinks, whichever you prefer. Avoid alcoholic beverages or beverages that contain caffeine, such as coffee, tea and soft drinks. Alcohol and caffeine will make you urinate and increase fluid loss (dehydration).

Watch for the following signs of dehydration:

sensation of extreme thirst;
dry mouth and tongue;
infrequent or dark urine;
dizziness, confusion and headaches.
Complications of COVID-19 can develop a few days after symptoms first appear. If symptoms become more acute, you must go to the emergency room immediately or, if you need help, call 911. Watch for the following signs of a deterioration:

body temperature over 38°C (100.4°F);
persistent or increasing difficulty breathing;
drowsiness, confusion, disorientation or difficulty staying awake;
no urine for 12 hours;
fever in a baby under 3 months of age."
How should I clean my environment?,"The virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can live on objects and surfaces. It can survive for:

3 hours on objects with dry surfaces;
6 days on objects with wet surfaces.
It is important to clean countertops, washbasins, door handles and any surfaces that are frequently touched by hands. Cleaning and disinfecting are very effective at eliminating the virus.

For cleaning, use soap and water or household cleaning products.
For disinfecting, use a bleach solution or a disinfectant. A solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water is recommended, that is, 10 mL of bleach in 90 mL of water.
If you are sick, your bed linen, towels, clothes and dishes can be washed with those of other household members using regular detergent."
How can I ask for help?,"If you are worried, do not hesitate to ask for or accept help. It is important to talk about it with your family and friends.

For home care, you can also call 211 or ask your CLSC to connect you with home care services.

For information about other support measures, go to the Québec.ca/coronavirus page."
What medications should I take to relieve my symptoms?,"Over-the-counter medications can be used to relieve the symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Before using, read the labels carefully and do not take more than the recommended dose. You are strongly advised to ask your pharmacist for advice before using over-the-counter medications if you have symptoms. Do not take products that contain the same ingredients at the same time, such as Tylenol® and Tylenol® Sinus. If you have health problems, ask your pharmacist for advice or call Info-Santé 811 before taking over-the-counter medications.

Taking anti-inflammatories may make coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worse, but this information is based on clinical observations and has not been confirmed or disproven. According to some recommendations, ibuprofen should not be taken by people who have COVID-19 to relieve fever. Advil® and Motrin® belong to this drug class. If you are already taking anti-inflammatories and you test positive for COVID-19, speak to your pharmacist, doctor or specialized nurse practitioner."
Is it preferable to avoid all public spaces?,"In order to protect Quebecers, the Gouvernement du Québec is prohibiting indoor and outdoor gatherings. However, provision has been made for several exceptions (see “Gatherings and events” section).

Individuals who must attend a gathering that the Gouvernement du Québec has exempted areare urged to remain for the shortest possible time and as far as possible to maintain a distance of 2 metres from other people."
What is the CNESST’s role regarding the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The CNESST is the government body in charge of administering the occupational health and safety plan. In matters of prevention, it is responsible, in particular, for monitoring compliance with the Act respecting occupational health and safety and its regulations and for ensuring that workplaces meet occupational health and safety requirements.Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the CNESST was listed as a priority health and social services organization by the Québec government.The CNESST is playing a leading role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and is working closely with the public health department on a daily basis.From the outset, inspectors were deployed throughout Québec to help workplaces implement adequate occupational health and safety measures.In the current context, the duties of these inspectors have not changed, because they provide priority services and the CNESST must ensure compliance with the Act respecting occupational health and safety and safety and its regulations.Nearly 300 CNESST inspectors take action, particularly in workplaces where employees have exercised their right to refuse to work under the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), where complaints have been filed or where serious industrial "
How does the CNESST intervene in the case of a priority or non-priority business?,"To comply with Order 223-2020, the CNESST has adjusted its response to complaints and the right to refuse to work in the case of a priority or non-priority business.If a concerned citizen (not a worker or a union association) complains or reports that a business is not complying with the order and it is still open, the CNESST will refer the citizen to the public health department of Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux.In the case of a non-priority business, if a worker or a union association files a complaint or exercises its right to refuse to work, the CNESST will contact the employer and look into the matter to ensure compliance with the order in collaboration with the region’s public health department. If the business is still open after this joint initiative, the CNESST will refer the matter to the appropriate law enforcement agency.If a worker or a union association files a complaint or exercises its right to refuse to work, the CNESST will document and review the file to determine whether the workplace has handled the biological hazard in accordance with the Act respecting occupational health and safety. The public health department may provide assistance if required.If you are wondering whether a business is considered a priority or not, please refer to Ministère de l’Économie et de l’Innovation."
Does an employer have to take special measures to protect the health of workers?​​​,"As stipulated in section 51 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), “every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker.”To this end, the employer must take measures to identify, control and eliminate the virus. Here are some examples of preventive measures that can be implemented to reduce this risk:Encouraging handwashing and proper respiratory etiquette (coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow)
Regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, doorknobs, tools and equipment
Adopting a work practice the encourages 2 metres of physical and social distancing from any person
Using technology for communication with and between workers
Supporting telework
Avoiding non-essential face-to-face meetings
Developing a procedure for exclusion from the workplace of workers exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms                         "
Can employees refuse to work if they think they may be infected with COVID-19?,"A worker must take the necessary measures to ensure his health, safety or physical well-being and see that he does not endanger the health, safety or physical well-being of other persons at or near his workplace. A worker who is experiencing symptoms should inform their employer of these symptoms.The employer must ask the worker about the risk factors underlying the need for self-isolation. If the employee refuses to comply, the employer may inform the employee that administrative or disciplinary action may be taken.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has passed the Quarantine Act. The Act requires that anyone returning from abroad self-isolate for 14 days. Those who fail to comply with this obligation are liable to a fine or imprisonment."
What recourses are there for employees whose work may be hazardous to their health,"Workers can file a complaint or report a dangerous situation. Complaints are reviewed to assess the risk and to determine if corrective and control measures are in order. To file a complaint, call the CNESST at 1-844-838-0808 and ask for an on-call inspector.Sections 12–13 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS) stipulate that “a worker has a right to refuse to perform particular work if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the performance of that work would expose him to danger to his health, safety or physical well-being, or would expose another person to a similar danger. No worker may, however, exercise his right under section 12 if his refusal to perform the work puts the life, health, safety or physical well-being of another person in immediate danger or if the conditions under which the work is to be performed are ordinary conditions in his kind of work.”Should a worker refuse to work, a CNESST inspector will promptly determine if there is any risk and will make sure that the procedure set out in the AOHS has been followed, i.e., that the worker has notified the immediate superior, the employer or its representative, and informed the union association representative or the prevention representative, as applicable.In addition, the AOHS also provides for the reassignment of pregnant and breastfeeding workers through its For a Safe Maternity Experience Program (FSMEP) and seeks to ensure that pregnant and breastfeeding workers remain safely employed.In view of the current situation, the CNESST is streamlining the FSMEP application procedure to facilitate access and to safeguard the health of pregnant workers and their unborn or breastfed children (see question 36 onward)."
Can the CNESST shut down a workplace due to COVID-19-related risks?,"In the event that a workplace does not comply with government guidelines and the employer does not address the COVID-19-related risk, a CNESST inspector could issue remedial notices to ensure that the employer identifies, controls and eliminates the biological hazard.If the inspector deems that the health, safety or physical well-being of workers is at risk, they may order the closure of the workplace until the employer takes corrective action."
What happens if there is a shortage of N95 respirators?,"In the event of such a shortage, there are other types of masks that meet the minimum standards of the N95.However, some of the masks offering equivalent protection may, for example, require additional training and fit testing to ensure a proper seal. A proper fit is necessary to limit infiltration that could expose the worker to the coronavirus.Moreover, it is the employer’s responsibility to ensure that alternative masks meet the appropriate safety standards for the tasks employees are required to perform. If necessary, the employer may contact the manufacturer to confirm whether the masks are compliant.As stipulated in section 51 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), “every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker.”"
"When a worker has been infected with COVID-19, does an employer necessarily have to disinfect the workplace or clean common areas in a special way?","If anyone has to use the work area of someone who has had flu-like symptoms, cleaning and disinfection of the surfaces will help limit the spread of the virus within the company. Cleaning the surfaces eliminates dirt. Disinfection kills the remaining microorganisms. According to section 152 of the Regulation respecting occupational health and safety, the word “disinfected” means being washed with a bleach-based solution or with some comparable product. . For more information,the INSPQ has issued recommendations:"
Can my employer force me to stay home if I have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms?,"Yes, an employer must insist that a worker stay at home if they believe there is a risk. As stipulated in section 51 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), “every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has passed the Quarantine Act. The Act requires that anyone returning from abroad self-isolate for 14 days. Those who fail to comply with this obligation are liable to a fine or imprisonment. These people must be vigilant and monitor their symptoms. Workers must inform their employer if they exhibit symptoms"
 What are the measures to be implemented on construction sites to reduce contamination linked to COVID-19?,"As stipulated in section 51 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety (AOHS), “every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker.” On construction sites, employers and the principal contractor share the responsibility to ensure the health and safety of workers , To this end, the employer must take measures to identify, control and eliminate the virus. For example, the employer must take the necessary sanitary measures to limit the spread of the virus. This obligation also applies to construction sites,In accordance with section 49 of the AOHS, a worker must “take the necessary measures to ensure his health, safety or physical well-being and see that he does not endanger the health, safety or physical well-being of other persons at or near his workplace.In the event that a workplace does not comply with government guidelines and the employer does not address the COVID-19-related risk, a CNESST inspector could demand that the workplace be closed until the employer takes corrective action.To address the construction industry’s concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19, at the request of the Minister of Labour, Employment and Social Solidarity, the CNESST has created the CNESST Tactical Committee – COVID-19 Construction Sites, bringing together employer and labour associations in the construction industry."
How must the employer verify the state of health of the workers arriving on the work site?,"Employers must inquire about the health of each of their workers daily, upon arrival at the work site, by having them answer the following questions: Do you have any of these symptoms: cough, fever, difficulty breathing, sudden loss of smell?
Have you been out of the country in the last 2 weeks?
Are you in contact with someone who has COVID-19? If worker answer yes to any of these questions, they must stay home.Temperature taking is not recommended because the results are unreliable, especially for people who work outdoors.It is important to tell workers to go back home if they have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 , Answers to these questions are confidential and employers must take the necessary steps to ensure their confidentiality"
What is the time period for an employee who had COVID-19 to return to work?,"The Direction générale de la santé publique authorizes people to be released from self-isolation once all the following criteria have been met.At least 14 days have elapsed since the onset of the disease in its acute phase
No acute symptoms in the past 24 hours (apart from a possible residual cough)
No fever in the past 48 hours (without using antipyretics) , As a general rule, hospitalization is not required for most people who become infected. Most people should therefore be able to stay at home.However, since the health care system is unable to certify that the above criteria have been met, a medical certificate is not required for a return to work."
What is the physical distancing to be respected on the work sites and during transportation of workers?,"Employers must make every effort to ensure that work is arranged in such a way that workers can maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from each other.Employers must also take care to ensure that a physical distance of 2 metres is observed during the following situations: arrival at the work site, breaks, meals and departure from the work site, Work must be scheduled in such a manner as to avoid having a large number of workers in the same place at the same time. That said, teams of workers should be kept together,If physical distancing cannot be respected for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, measures must be taken to protect the workers (refer to the section on personal protective equipment).Physical distancing may not be possible for a short period due to the nature of the work to be done. Consequently, workers should always avoid touching their face and should cough into their elbow.In terms of transportation, vehicles should be operated at half the seating capacity. Having two workers in the same vehicle is permitted.It is also recommended to avoid face-to-face meetings and to use the telephone or the Internet instead."
 What are the hygiene measures to be implemented for construction sites?,"Presence of toilets on site , A toilet must be made available to workers from the first day of work. For work sites with 25 workers or more, flushing toilets and sinks are required in accordance with the Safety Code for the construction industry.In fact, a sink containing clean and temperate water must be placed at the disposal of workers for each flushing toilet. It must be maintained in good operating condition.The following products must also be placed at the disposal of workers:Soap or another cleansing agent
A hand dryer, roller towels or paper towels , Where paper towels are used, waste paper baskets, contactless if possible, must be used for their disposa , Other measures to be implemented ,A notice indicating that the water is not suitable as drinking water must be displayed so that it is visible to workers.
For work sites with no more than 24 workers, a chemical toilet may be used.
Toilets must be washed at least twice per work shift—half way through and at the end.
It is important to clean surfaces that workers are likely to touch.Presence of water for hand washing , The employer must ensure that workers have the means to wash their hands at the construction site.
Encouraging hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds should be a priority at the work site.
If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based gel (60% or more) must be used for at least 20 seconds.
Mobile cleaning units (rentals) are recommended where appropriate. All workers on site must clean their hands:

Upon arriving at and leaving the work site
Before and after eating
Before and after a break
Before smoking
When they go to the toilet ,Keeping the lunch room clean
According to the Safety Code for the construction industry, “on any work site where there are 10 or more workers and where the work lasts more than 7 days, the employer must make a room available to the workers where they may take their meals”.

It is important to clean the lunch room tables before and after each use. The table should be covered with an easily washable surface (plastic or smooth), and the lunch room and its appliances and accessories (refrigerator, microwave, chairs, handles, etc.) should be cleaned every shift to avoid infection.

Depending on how the site is set up, there are many ways to ensure that workers can maintain a social distance of 2 metres between each other during meals: adding trailers, scheduling more than one meal time so workers are not all in the trailer at the same time.

It is also important to leave some space between work clothes hung up in the trailer, and tools, equipment and supplies must not be stored in the lunch room.Tool cleaning
It is recommended that workers do not share tools with each other. If they must, the tools must be disinfected whenever they change hands.

At the end of each shift, it is important to clean and disinfect shared tools and work equipment.

Using gloves does not protect workers against COVID-19. The important thing is to not put your gloves or hands in your face.

According to the public health department, the virus does not penetrate the skin. It is therefore recommended to follow general hygiene practices such as not putting your hands or gloves in your face and washing your hands regularly.

To remove your gloves without becoming infected, it is recommended to follow the procedure provided by Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux"
What are the preventive measures to be implemented during work on a contaminated site?,"When carrying out emergency work (plumbing, electricity, etc.) at a contaminated site, always keep a social distance of at least 2 metres from any infected person. It is important to wash your hands and tools when you leave the site."
Must workers use personal protective equipment (PPE) specific to COVID-19 on a construction site?,"It is not recommended for construction workers to wear specific personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves against COVID-19 when 2-metre physical distancing is respected.If the tasks absolutely must must be performed within 2 metres of another person for for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, workers are required to:

If the tasks absolutely must must be performed within 2 metres of another person for for more than 15 minutes without a physical barrier, workers are required to:

Wear a procedure mask (surgical mask) and protective glasses (protective eyewear)
ou

Wear a visor.
Wearing a visor must not represent an additional risk for the worker's safety in performing tasks.

Use of an SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) that meets the above-mentioned requirements.

The best thing to do is to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face"
"Are there solutions for dealing with COVID-19-related stress, anxiety and depression?","The whole COVID-19 situation has been a rather strange and unusual development. It is normal for people to be afraid, stressed, anxious or depressed.The best way to get better is to be well informed, to take care of yourself and to seek help when needed."
Has the service of statements of offence been limited or suspended?,"The CNESST is limiting the service of statements of offence but still reserves the option to serve those related to a serious violation concerning the health, safety and physical integrity of a worker. The CNESST may therefore serve a statement of offence related to a serious or fatal accident or to COVID-19. It may also serve statements of offence to avoid having its criminal proceedings subject to a statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is one year following the perpetration of an offence."
What do I do if my workplace first aid card expires?,"Due to the exceptional circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the CNESST has decided to extend the validity of workplace first aid cards by 6 months.The CNESST recognizes that it will be difficult for employers to register their employees for the courses required to renew their workplace first aid cards in accordance with the First-aid Minimum Standards Regulation, and has addressed this issue by introducing a relief measure.

As such, all expiring CNESST workplace first aid cards will be valid for an extra 6 months without the employer or the first-aider having to make a request.

The CNESST reserves the right to revise this directive as the situation develops.

Reminder: the only card recognized to meet the requirements of the First-aid Minimum Standards Regulation is the CNESST’s blue workplace first aid card."
 Do I have the right to sick leave?,"Yes. You have the right to be off work, without pay, due to illness or accident. If you have three months of uninterrupted service, you can receive up to two paid days of leave a year.Total absences must not exceed 26 weeks over a 12-month period. This 12-month period starts on the date of the first absence. An employee’s regular position and related benefits are protected by law for the duration of their leave.

Your employer must reinstate you to your regular position and give you the salary you would have been entitled to had you remained at work."
Does my employer have to pay for my sick days?​​​,"If you have three months of uninterrupted service, you can receive up to two paid sick days a year.Beyond those two sick days, the Act respecting labour standards does not require an employer to pay an employee for absences due to illness. It is the employer’s choice to provide paid sick days.

If you are a union member, check the leave provisions in your collective agreement.

To get employment insurance benefits, you must apply to Employment and Social Development Canada."
Will I lose my job if I take sick leave?,"Your right to return to the position you held at the time of your departure and the benefits associated with it is protected by law.When you are ready to return to work after being absent due to sickness or accident for no more than 26 weeks in a 12-month period, your employer must reinstate you to your regular position and give you the level of pay you would have been entitled to had you remained at work.

If your regular position no longer exists when you return, your employer must give you all the rights and privileges you would have had when the position was eliminated."
" If someone in my family has COVID-19, can I take time off work to care for them?","Yes. You can be absent from work for up to ten days a year to fulfill obligations regarding the care, health or education of your child or your spouse’s child or a relative’s medical condition. “Relative” can refer to the employee’s spouse as well as to the employee’s or the spouse’s children, father, mother, brothers, sisters or grandparents and to any of their spouses, their children and their children’s spouses.You are also entitled to this leave if someone for whom you act as a caregiver has a medical condition that requires you to take time off work.

In all cases, however, you must notify your employer of your absence as soon as possible and take reasonable steps to limit your leave and its duration.

If you have three months of uninterrupted service, you may also be entitled to two paid absences a year.

It is important to remember that, of the ten days provided for in the law, only the first two are paid. The eight others are unpaid. These ten days of leave per year may be split into days and taken at any time during the year. They may also be split into half-days if the employer agrees."
Schools and daycares are closed. Can I take time off to look after my child?​​​,"Yes, if you have notified your employer of your absence as soon as possible and have taken reasonable steps to limit the length of your leave, you may take time off from work.The law gives you ten days per year to fulfil obligations related to the care, health or education of your child or the child of your spouse.

If you have three months of uninterrupted service, you may also be entitled to two paid absences a year. It is important to remember that, of the ten days provided for in the law, only the first two are paid. The eight others are unpaid.

These ten days of leave per year may be split into days and taken at any time during the year. They may also be split into half-days if the employer agrees."
Schools and daycares will be closed for more than ten days. Does that mean that I will not be paid for the duration of these closures?,"Not necessarily. If someone has the option to work from home by arrangement with their employer, they keep their salary.If the person does not work, the employer is under no obligation to provide remuneration. An employer may, however, reach an arrangement with the employee so the latter receives their salary during their absence in return for work to be performed at a later date."
Can my employer ask me what country I went to on my vacation? Can he or she demand that I share that information?,"The Act respecting labour standards makes no provisions for this.However, it is the responsibility of each individual to protect their own health and that of their colleagues by answering their employer’s question.

All foreign countries are covered by the government order"
Can I be fired if I refuse to work overtime because I have to take care of my sick parents?,"No. Your employer cannot dismiss you for that.As long as you have taken reasonable steps to fulfil your family obligations otherwise, you have the right to refuse to work more than your usual working hours to fulfil obligations regarding the care, health or education of your child or your spouse’s child, or the medical condition of a relative or someone for whom you are acting as a caregiver."
" If an employer asks an employee to go home for mandatory isolation, does the employer have to pay the employee’s salary?","If the employee does not perform work, the employer is not obliged to pay their salary.The employer may, however, show understanding and reach an arrangement so the employee receives their salary during their absence in return for work to be performed at a later date.

If you feel that your suspension was unjustified, you can file a complaint with the CNESST. The Tribunal administratif du travail will determine whether the suspension was warranted."
What are my responsibilities to my employees if I have to close my business temporarily?,"At any time, if you must lay off employees for a period of less than 6 months, you are not obliged to give them a written notice. A verbal notice is permitted. Due to the measures taken by the Government in the context of the pandemic, a verbal notice is also permitted if you must close your business temporarily, regardless of length of this closure,Dismissal or layoff of more than 6 months

If you must dismiss employees (that is, permanently terminate their employment) or lay them off for a period of 6 months or longer, you must give a written notice of termination of employment to the persons who have at least 3 months of uninterrupted service. The deadline in which the notice must be delivered depends on the length of uninterrupted service:

less than 3 months of uninterrupted service: no minimum period
3 months to 1 year of uninterrupted service: 1 week
1 to 5 years 2 weeks
5 to 10 years 4 weeks
11 years or more 8 weeks
If you do not give this written notice, or if you do not give it within the required period, you will have to pay each employee a compensatory indemnity equivalent to his usual wages for a period equal to the period (or the residual period) of the notice to which the employee was entitled. This indemnity must not account for overtime.

This indemnity must be paid, as the case may be, at the time of the dismissal or at the time of the layoff projected for more than six months.

It is also possible that you wish to proceed with layoffs for an indeterminate period because you do not know in advance if the layoffs will extend beyond six months. In this case, you will have to pay the compensatory indemnity after a six-month layoff.

For more details, we invite you to refer to the section of our website concerning the notice of termination of employment

Collective dismissal

There is a collective dismissal if, over a period of 2 consecutive months, you terminate the employment of 10 or more employees of the same establishment, or lay them off for a period of more than 6 months.

In this case, before proceeding with such a dismissal, you must send a notice to the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, within the following minimum deadlines:

nine weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 10 and less than 100;
12 weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 100 and less than 300;
16 weeks, when the the number of employees concerned by the dismissal is at least equal to 300;
You must send a copy of this notice to the Commission des normes, de l'équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail and the certified association representing the employees, if one exists. You must also post the notice in your establishment.

At the time of the dismissal, you must pay the dismissed employees all the amounts due to them: wages, overtime, vacation pay (4% or 6%), etc.

All the persons concerned by a notice of collective dismissal must also receive a notice of termination of employment according to the periods provided for by law (indicated above). The persons concerned could be entitled to indemnities if these two notices are not given to them within the required periods."
Can I demand a medical certificate proving that an employee is not sick?,"It is not recommended to go to hospitals or medical clinics at the moment, especially if you are not sick.If you insist that an employee provide a medical certificate, be aware that the associated costs may be considered operating expenses and fringe benefits.

If you ask an employee to be away from work during their shift in order to obtain a medical certificate, you must pay the employee for their time.

The law provides that an employee is deemed to be at work if travelling at the employer’s request."
Can my employer force me to use my vacation leave or two days of paid sick leave ( permitted by law)?,"Your employer cannot force you to take your annual vacation unless they give you at least four weeks’ notice. You have the right to know when your annual vacation is going to start four weeks in advance.As for family- or sickness-related leave days:

There is no clause that would allow an employer to force you to use this leave. That would defeat the purpose of the Act:

Family-related leave is granted to employees who need to be off work for reasons related to the health or education of a child or to the medical condition of a relative (see definition).
Sick leave is granted to employees who need to be off work because they are sick.
It should be noted that no matter the reason (family obligation or sickness), employees are entitled to only two paid days of leave per year."
What can I do if I do not receive a record of employment or termination of employment?,"At any time, if an employer must lay off employees for a period of less than 6 months, the employer is under no obligation to give them a written notice. A verbal notice is sufficient. Due to government measures taken in response to the pandemic, a verbal notice is also permitted if the employer must close the business temporarily, regardless of length of this closure.If an employer must dismiss employees (that is, permanently terminate their employment) or lay them off for a period of 6 months or longer, the employer must give a written notice of termination of employment to the persons who have at least 3 months of uninterrupted service. The deadline in which the notice must be delivered depends on the length of uninterrupted service:

less than 3 months of uninterrupted service: no minimum period
3 months to 1 year of uninterrupted service: 1 week
1 to 5 years 2 weeks
5 to 10 years 4 weeks
10 years or more 8 weeks
Therefore, if you do not receive the notice to which you are entitled or if you receive insufficient notice, your employer must pay you an indemnity equal to your usual salary for the duration (or remaining duration) of the notice to which you are entitled. This indemnity must be paid at the time of the dismissal or at the time of the layoff projected for more than six months.

If your employer refuses to pay you the indemnity to which you are entitled, you can file a complaint with the CNESST.

It should be noted that the notice of termination of employment provided for in the Act respecting labour standards is different from the record of employment that an employer must provide for employment insurance purposes. For more information on records of employment, please refer to the Service Canada website."
Can a worker who contracted the coronavirus (COVID-19) through exposure in the workplace be compensated?,"Yes, workers who become infected with COVID-19 during the course of their employment may be entitled to the usual benefits and services provided under the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases (AIAOD).The worker must see a physician or, exceptionally, a nurse who will make the diagnosis, notify the employer and complete the worker’s claim so it can be submitted to the CNESST. The worker must demonstrate that they came into contact with the virus through or in the course of their work. The work connection must be demonstrated in a conclusive manner.

The CNESST’s decision will take into account the specifics of each claim."
What is the procedure for making a COVID-19-related claim?,"As with other types of employment injuries, a worker seeking compensation for an industrial accident must fill out the Worker’s Claim form and send it to the CNESST.Exceptionally, the CNESST will accept a medical certificate confirming a COVID-19 diagnosis issued by a nurse and accompanied by the analysis results.

The CNESST encourages workers to make their claims online at My CNESST Space."
What kind of compensation can a worker receive?,"Once a claim has been accepted, the worker can be reimbursed for medical assistance (e.g., drugs), travel expenses, accommodation costs, etc.To be compensated, the worker must fill out the Application for Reimbursement of Expenses form. Claims can be made online.

If the employee becomes unable to work, they may be entitled to income replacement benefits."
"If the CNESST accepts a worker’s claim, when will they receive compensation?","As soon as the claim has been accepted, the worker may be reimbursed for all costs incurred for care, treatment or drugs in connection with the employment injury and in accordance with the legal provisions. In addition, the worker may be entitled to income replacement benefits should they have to stop working as a result of the employment injury."
"Can claims be made for secondary exposure (e.g., if a worker’s close relative is infected)?","No, only workers who contract the disease as a result of their work can be compensated."
" If a pregnant worker decided to stay home right now while waiting for her doctor’s appointment and the CNESST’s decision, would she be eligible for retroactive compensation?​​​","Pregnant workers can stop working before seeing a doctor.They must inform their employer of the reasons for their immediate withdrawal from work (COVID-19). The employer will acknowledge the danger present at the worker’s workstation and confirm an assignment to safe work or preventive withdrawal.

The danger (COVID-19) must be present in the workplace. The worker must:

See a doctor as soon as possible
Get a Preventive Withdrawal and Reassignment Certificate for a Pregnant or Breast-feeding Worker (PWC)
Give the PWC to the employer
If the worker is eligible for the For a Safe Maternity Experience Program (FSMEP) and is on preventive withdrawal, she may be retroactively entitled to income replacement benefits.

If the application is denied, the worker is not entitled to income replacement benefits"
" Regarding the risks associated with COVID-19 infection, has the CNESST provided special measures for the withdrawal of pregnant women?​​","Yes. Given the ongoing spread of COVID-19, the CNESST has streamlined the processing of preventive withdrawal requests for pregnant healthcare workers. Here are the two possible scenarios:Pregnant workers who have already obtained a Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and who perform one of the tasks set out in section 5 of the Institut national de santé publique (INSPQ) document Recommandations intérimaires sur les mesures de prévention en milieux de travail pour les travailleuses enceintes ou qui allaitent:
may be immediately withdrawn from work
do not need to obtain a new Preventive Withdrawal Certificate or a new job analysis
For new preventive withdrawal applications and when the worker is unable to see a doctor to obtain a Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and a job analysis, a nurse must confirm:
that the worker is pregnant
that she is able to work
In the latter scenario, if the employer is unable to get a job analysis from Direction de la santé publique, the employer must submit a document confirming that the pregnant healthcare worker is performing one of the tasks set out in section 5 of the above-mentioned document.

Upon receipt of these two documents (Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and confirmation of a covered job), the CNESST will be able to process the preventive withdrawal application."
What are the steps for a pregnant worker to apply for reassignment due to the coronavirus?,"Pregnant workers in healthcare settings, including dedicated COVID-19 clinics , Given the current COVID-19 outbreak, the CNESST has streamlined the processing of preventive withdrawal requests for pregnant healthcare workers. Here are the two possible scenarios:

Pregnant workers who have already obtained a Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and who perform one of the tasks set out in section 5 of the Institut national de santé publique (INSPQ) document Recommandations intérimaires sur les mesures de prévention en milieux de travail pour les travailleuses enceintes ou qui allaitent

must be reassigned to a position where this risk is not present or immediately withdrawn from work
do not need to obtain a new Preventive Withdrawal Certificate or a new job analysis
For new preventive withdrawal applications, the worker must see a physician to get a Preventive Withdrawal Certificate.

In the latter scenario, if the employer is unable to get a job analysis from the public health department, the employer must submit a document confirming that the pregnant healthcare worker is performing one of the tasks set out in section 5 of the above-mentioned document.

Upon receipt of these two documents (Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and confirmation of a covered job), the CNESST will be able to process the preventive withdrawal application.

Pregnant workers in non-healthcare settings

Pregnant workers who do not work in a healthcare setting or at a dedicated COVID-19 clinic must first inform their employer of their request for preventive withdrawal and the reasons for their immediate withdrawal from work (COVID-19). If the employer acknowledges the COVID-19 risk, but cannot provide reassignment, the worker may stop working before seeing her doctor.

The worker must then:

See her doctor as soon as possible
Get a Preventive Withdrawal Certificate
Give the Preventive Withdrawal Certificate to her employer
Upon receipt of these two documents (Preventive Withdrawal Certificate and confirmation of a covered job), the CNESST will be able to process the preventive withdrawal application.

If the worker is eligible for the For a Safe Maternity Experience Program and is on preventive withdrawal, she will be retroactively compensated."
What happens to workers on reassignment if an employer closes due to COVID-19?,The CNESST continues to pay income replacement benefits.The employer or the worker must inform the CNESST that the company has been closed.
"What happens to workers on reassignment if an employer cuts back (e.g., emergency dental clinics)? ​​​","The worker retains her employment benefits (section 43 of the Act respecting occupational health and safety).The employer may request reassignment support if the worker remains on reassignment.

If the worker is on preventive withdrawal, she will continue to receive income replacement benefits."
"What happens if a pregnant worker is exposed to COVID-19 while on reassignment in a healthcare setting, including a dedicated COVID-19 clinic?","The worker may be withdrawn from work without obtaining a new Preventive Withdrawal Certificate or a new job analysis if the following conditions are met:She has been exposed to the new hazard (COVID-19)
She perform one or more of the tasks set out in section 5 of the document Recommandations intérimaires sur les mesures de prévention en milieu de travail pour les travailleuses enceintes ou qui allaitent
The employer cannot reassign her to a hazard-free work environment (no COVID-19)"

"What happens to workers on preventive withdrawal if an employer cuts back (e.g., emergency dental clinics)?",Nothing changes—she will continue to receive income replacement benefits.
Some physicians refuse to issue a new Preventive Withdrawal Certificate for new hazards. They say they do not have enough information to determine if COVID-19 is a new hazard. What to do?,"The worker’s physician must obtain the medico-environmental analysis (job analysis) from the public health department to find out about the risks.Your public health department’s contact information can be found under the ""RÉGIONS"" section of the Réseau de santé publique en santé au travail website."

Will my income replacement benefits be suspended if I miss an appointment due to COVID-19?,"The CNESST urges you to reschedule non-essential and non-urgent appointments to a later date. So if you miss care or treatment due to the coronavirus pandemic, your income replacement benefits will continue .Nevertheless, try to reschedule your appointments at least 24 hours in advance if possible. The CNESST does not reimburse cancellation fees charged by a medical facility when a worker does not show up for an appointment."
Do I have to inform the CNESST if the physical and occupational therapy clinic is closed?,"No, you do not have to inform the CNESST"
Are remote treatment or consultation payable?,"If the worker’s situation and condition are suitable, the CNESST will permit remote treatment and consultation provided that it is done in accordance with professional order rules As for the attendance register, it is recommended that clinics and practitioners obtain an email from the worker confirming that they have received treatment."
"Since it is harder to get a medical appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic, can I see another healthcare professional for my care?","Exceptionally, the CNESST will accept recommendations issued by a doctor, dentist, optometrist or pharmacist in their respective areas of expertise, as it is harder to get a medical appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic Furthermore, exceptionally, the CNESST can analyze worker claims related to COVID-19 when the medical certificate is completed by a nurse confirming this diagnosis and accompanied by the analysis results"
"In the current context of COVID-19, will the CNESST accept an audiogram dated more than 12 months ago for authorization to purchase or renew hearing prostheses?","Given the current COVID-19 situation, the CNESST will accept audiograms up to 14 months old."
Will the billing deadline be extended for providers?,"Exceptionally, the 180-day deadline will be calculated from the date on which the special measures are lifted by the government. The CNESST will inform orders and associations of the exact date in a timely manner."
"Will clinics still be able to use the CNESST’s Physio-Ergo app to submit physical and occupational therapy documents after April 1, 2020?","Given the current situation, the CNESST will exceptionally extend the Physio-Ergo rollout phase beyond March 31, 2020. The CNESST Physio-Ergo app will therefore remain available beyond April 1, 2020.As the situation develops, discussions will be held with each of the software manufacturers to determine how to continue the rollout to the remaining clinics."
Do I have to keep a medical appointment requested by the CNESST?,"The CNESST is postponing all medical assessments until further notice,The CNESST will notify you that your appointment has been postponed in a timely manner.,The CNESST will also notify the designated medical professionals in a timely manner.,You and your employer will receive a written notice when a new appointment date has been set."
The CNESST requested that I see a respirologist for an occupational lung disease claim. Do I have to show up for the appointment?,"The CNESST is postponing all scheduled lung disease assessments with respirologists until further notice.,The CNESST will notify you that your appointment has been postponed in a timely manner.,The CNESST will also notify the relevant health professionals in a timely manner."
"What does the CNESST suggest for my employer, who has arranged a medical assessment?","The CNESST encourages employers to postpone non-urgent medical assessments, to reduce the propagation of COVID-19.Furthermore, no income replacement benefits will be suspended by the CNESST."
The Bureau d’évaluation médicale (BEM) has requested that I submit to a medical assessment. Do I have to keep the appointment?,"The BEM has suspended all appointments and is informing the CNESST, on an ongoing basis, of appointments that have been moved to later dates.The BEM will notify you of this deferral and the date of your next appointment in a timely manner."
Will the 30-day deadline for supplementary reports be extended for attending physicians?,"Yes, the CNESST is extending the deadline for submitting supplementary reports by 30 days during the COVID-19 pandemic. Attending physicians will therefore have 60 days from the date of the request to respond to the Commission. This extension may be reassessed as circumstances change."
I have to take a leave of absence from my temporary work assignment due to COVID-19. Will the CNESST resume my income replacement benefits?,"Every employer must take the necessary measures to protect the health and ensure the safety and physical well-being of his worker. However, these situations may arise:,You are under mandatory isolation in accordance with the Québec government’s COVID-19 health guidelines. The CNESST will continue or resume your income replacement benefits.
Work goes on at your company and there are no medical conditions or government guidelines that would justify your absence from work. The CNESST will assess the reasons put forward and then inform you if your income replacement benefits are being continued or suspended.
Your employer has implemented company-wide telework so everyone can temporarily be reassigned to work from home. The CNESST will consider this to be a continuation of your temporary reassignment and you will have to go through with it.
A company or organization (e.g., sports centre, daycare centre, school) is closed or ceases some of its operations in accordance with the Québec government’s COVID-19 health guidelines. As a result, your temporary work assignment comes to an end. The CNESST will resume your income replacement benefits from the date of cessation of work.
The worker or the employer must inform the CNESST that the temporary reassignment has ended."
"I have to be absent from my temporary work assignment because someone I live with has risk factors (medical condition, age), will my benefits be resumed?",The CNESST considers this to be a valid reason and will resume the income replacement benefits
 I want to be represented for a request for review. How can I submit the representation mandate?,"Due to the state of health emergency in effect all across Québec, submitting representation mandates by mail or fax may be complicated for workers. In these circumstances, the CNESST is encouraging duly completed representation mandates to be submitted through My CNESST Space.The worker can, exceptionally, inform the CNESST verbally of their intention to be represented. The worker must undertake to submit a duly completed representation mandate as soon as the relief measures have been lifted.

To inform the CNESST of your intention to be represented, please call us at 1-844-838-0808."
Is it still possible to contest the decisions rendered by the CNESST?,"Yes. It is still possible for workers and employers to contest a decision.However, if you find it is impossible for you to contest a decision within the 30-day period provided by the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases, the CNESST will show flexibility and consideration for the unusual circumstances caused by the current COVID-19 crisis if the reason for missing the deadline was related to COVID-19"
 Is there any documentation on COVID-19-related issues?,"The CNESST website has several sources of information as well as health and safety awareness tools. It also features documentation on biological hazards, the right to refuse to work and sick leave standards.A web page addressing key workplace-related questions has been made available on the CNESST website.

For information on the COVID-19 situation in Québec, please visit quebec.ca/en/coronavirus."
Are animals responsible for COVID-19 in people?,"The predominant route of transmission of COVID-19 is from human to human.Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an animal source. Genetic sequence data reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of other CoV found circulating in Rhinolophus bat (Horseshoe Bat) populations. However, to date, there is not enough scientific evidence to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2 or to explain the original route of transmission to humans (which may have involved an intermediate host)..

Investigations are needed to find the source, to determine how the virus entered the human population, and establish the potential role of an animal reservoir in this disease.

Priorities for research to investigate the animal source were discussed by the OIE informal advisory group on COVID-19, now the OIE ad hoc Group on COVID-19 and the human-animal interface, and were presented at the WHO Global Research and Innovation Forum (11-12 February 2020) by the President of the OIE Wildlife Working Group. For more information on the OIE ad hoc Group on COVID-19 and the human-animal interface and the WHO R&D roadmap please see the links under ‘more information’ at the bottom of this page."
Can animals be infected with SARS-CoV-2?,"Now that SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely distributed in the human population, there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 virus may have implications for animal health and welfare, for wildlife conservation, and for biomedical research.Dogs, cats (domestic cats and a tiger), and minks have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the field setting, following close contact with infected humans (or humans suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2). Further information about these events, which have reported to the OIE, can be found below in the ‘more information’ section.

Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. To date, preliminary findings from studies suggest that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Preliminary findings from laboratory studies suggest that, of the animal species investigated so far, cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and cats can be affected with clinical disease. In the laboratory setting cats were able to transmit infection to other cats. Ferrets appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected by clinical disease. In the laboratory setting ferrets were also able to transmit infection to other ferrets. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for future studies e.g. to evaluate vaccines or therapeutics. Dogs appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected than ferrets or cats. Egyptian fruit bats were also infected in the laboratory setting but did not show signs of disease. The fruit bats did appear to be able to transmit infection to other fruit bats.

The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals play a significant a role in spreading the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare."
What precautionary measures should be taken when companion or other animals have close contact with humans suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2?,"Currently, there is no evidence that animals are playing a significant epidemiological role in the spread of human infections with SARS-CoV-2. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 limit contact with animals When handling and caring for all animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.

People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should minimise close direct contact with animals, including farm animals, zoo animals, other captive animals, and wildlife; particularly species which have demonstrated to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. As good practice, appropriate and effective biosecurity measures should always be practiced when people have contact with groups of animals e.g. on farms, at zoos, and in animal shelters.

When possible, people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals. If they must look after their pets, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be kept indoors as much as possible and contact with those pets should be avoided as much as possible."
What can National Veterinary Services do with regards to companion animals?,"Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 reports being in contact with companion or other animals.If a decision is made, as a result of a risk assessment, to test a companion animal which has had close contact with a person/owner infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal and fecal/rectal samples. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of specimens from the environment or by humans.

Animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be kept away from unexposed animals and contact with those animals should be avoided as much as possible"
Are there any precautions to take with live animals or animal products?,"Although there is uncertainty about the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in accordance with advice offered by the WHO, as a general precaution when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets, general hygiene measures should be applied. These include regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products, as well as avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth, and avoiding contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products. Any contact with other animals possibly living in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats) should be avoided. Precaution should be taken to avoid contact with animal waste or fluids on the soil or surfaces of shops and market facilities.Standard recommendations issued by WHO to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose with the elbow when coughing and sneezing and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.  As per general good food safety practices, raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid potential cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Meat from healthy livestock that is prepared and served in accordance with good hygiene and food safety principles remains safe to eat. Further recommendations from WHO can be consulted here.

The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012) and others which can be consulted on the Codex website.

OIE is actively monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals, research, and risk analyses with an animal focus, and analysing implications for safe trade in animals and animal products. Based on currently available information, and with the support of expert advisory groups, the OIE makes no specific recommendations for COVID-19 related sanitary measures for the international trade of animals or animal products for countries reporting cases of COVID-19 in humans. Evidence-based risk management principles guide trade in animal species (or their products) demonstrated to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Evaluation and implementation of risk management for safe trade should follow the principles laid out in Section 2 (Risk Analysis) and Section 5 (Trade Measures, Import/Export Procedures and Veterinary/Health Certification) of the Terrestrial and Aquatic Animal Health Codes. Precautions for packaging materials are unnecessary over and above the observation of basic hygiene, such as ensuring it is clean and free of visible contamination. The report of the OIE ad hoc Group on COVID-19 and Safe Trade in Animals and Animal Products can be consulted here."
What are the Veterinary Authority’s international responsibilities in this event?,"The infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease.Therefore, any (case of) infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to the OIE in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and include information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information.

It is important for Veterinary Authorities to remain informed and maintain close liaison with public health authorities and those responsible for wildlife, to ensure coherent and appropriate risk communication messages and risk management.

It is important that COVID-19 does not lead to inappropriate measures being taken against domestic or wild animals which might compromise their welfare and health or have a negative impact on biodiversity.

In some countries, National Veterinary Services are supporting core functions of the public health response, such as screening and testing of surveillance and diagnostic samples from humans. Veterinary clinics in some countries are also supporting the public health response by donating essential materials such as personal protective equipment and ventilators.

Guidance on Veterinary Laboratory Support to the Public Health Response for COVID-19 is available at the bottom of this document.

The OIE considers Veterinary Services as essential services. Veterinary Authorities can advocate for this within national COVID-19 response plans and operations, to ensure activities related to animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health risk management continue, under appropriate hygiene protocols, to safeguard the ongoing production of the many and varied goods derived from animals, animal products and animal by-products upon which our societies depend."
What is the OIE doing?,"The OIE is in contact with its Regional Representations and Sub Regional Representations, OIE Delegates of Member Countries, the OIE Wildlife Working Group, as well as FAO and WHO, to gather and share the latest available information. The OIE is closely liaising with its network of experts involved in current investigations on the source of the disease. Rumours and unofficial information are also monitored daily.The OIE has mobilized several technical working groups (‘ad hoc groups’) to provide scientific advice on research priorities, on-going research, and other implications of COVID-19 for animal health and veterinary public health, including risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. The OIE has also developed high level guidance for veterinary laboratories working with public health services to support testing of human samples for SARS-CoV-2.

The OIE has put in place an Incident Coordination System to coordinate these activities.

Given the similarities between COVID-19 and the emergence of other human infectious diseases at the human animal interface, the OIE is working with its Wildlife Working Group and other partners to develop a longer term work programme which aims to better understand the dynamics and risks around wildlife trade and consumption, with a view to developing strategies to reduce the risk of future spillover events."
"If someone gets the virus and then recovers, can that person become infected again? Or are they immune?","Experts don’t think someone can catch this virus twice but at this point they’re not sure. “That has yet to be answered because we’re so early on in the outbreak,” says Vaisman.There were earlier reports of somebody testing initially positive, then negative and then positive again. Although this may have been due to the fact that the middle negative test was what we call a ‘false negative.’ It wasn’t an accurate test. But we don’t know the answer to that yet. Future research is going to be required.”

It’s possible, for example, that a patient’s immunity to COVID-19 could weaken if the virus mutates. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate rapidly, which is why people continue catching the flu every year.

“Every year it’s a slightly different virus that we’re talking with,” says Jeff Kwong, a family physician and public-health professor at the University of Toronto. “And we don’t know enough yet about this new coronavirus, if it mutates as quickly as influenza.”"
What happens after my 14-day isolation period is over? Can I go visit my grandkids?,"Now’s not the time to go and visit your other family members,” says Sumontra Chakrabarti, an infectious disease specialist with Mississauga Halton Healthline.“We understand there has to be some essential things, like going to get groceries. Sometimes people have to go to certain types of doctor appointments. But,  if you’re going to go outside, what we recommend is that you keep yourself away, at least two metres, from everybody else.”"
"I self-isolated because I had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but I’m no longer feeling symptoms. Am I still contagious?","“This is a very good question and it’s a research question,” says Dr. Ronald St. John, the former director-general of the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response at the Public Health Agency of Canada.“There are some scattered reports of the virus being detected by molecular testing on people who are several days past being discharged from the hospital and who were deemed to be recovered.”

“It looks like that if you start from day one with symptoms, you’re contagious for about eight days,” says Sumontra Chakrabarti.

“One thing that’s important to note, though, is that in the mild cases, the symptoms only lasts for about five to seven days. So it’s possible, even when your symptoms go away, you could have some contagion for a couple of days after that.”"
"Is loss of smell a symptom of coronavirus, particularly in asymptomatic people?","A team of leading ear, nose and throat doctors in the U.K. have warned that people experiencing the loss of smell or taste could be “hidden carriers” of the virus, capable of spreading it without realizing. They compiled data from a number of countries, including Germany and South Korea, that found a growing number of patients with little to no other symptoms aside from losing the sense of smell.But a diminished sense of taste and smell can be symptomatic of a wide variety of illnesses, and isn’t definitive of COVID-19 at this point, according to Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist based out of Toronto General Hospital.
“I doubt this is a very specific feature of COVID-19. It might be a feature, but likely not a uniquely distinctive one compared to other infections,” he said.
Bogoch said it’s not unreasonable that people with the new coronavirus could see a decrease in their sense of smell, but said on the scale of symptom importance, it’s “minimal.”
“It’s a common symptom in many infections. It’s usually extremely mild,” he said. “If people truly have no other symptoms at all, I don’t think it would be wise to start rushing to testing centres.”"
Do we know anything about the consequences of the virus on pregnant women and on the fetus?,"“We don’t know yet about the effect of the virus on the fetus or on the pregnant woman,” says infectious disease expert Alon Vaisman. “But so far, the evidence has been very reassuring that there hasn’t been transmission from mom to baby.” COVID-19 has had remarkably little impact on babies and children, but they can become infected. A newborn baby in London reportedly tested positive for coronavirus just minutes after birth. The child’s mother had been admitted to hospital days earlier with suspected pneumonia. It’s not known whether the child contracted the disease in the womb or was infected during birth.

Vaisman says a pregnant woman’s weakened immune system and regular check-ups may put them at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus. “When it comes to pregnant women, these (medical) appointments are absolutely necessary to make sure everything’s OK. The only thing we could recommend is to avoid contact with people as much within reason.”"
How will COVID-19 respond to the warmer spring/summer weather we are fast-approaching?,"Seasonal influenza thrives in the northern hemisphere during the winter and then tapers off in the warmer spring and summer months. But experts aren’t sure whether COVID-19 will follow a similar pattern.“Nobody has any idea what the spread of this virus is going to do when it gets warmer,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital. “There have been some theories that perhaps it will behave like influenza. However, given the spread of this around the world, in many parts of the world that are warmer than here, I think we need to put that whole ‘it’s all going to go away in the summer’ thing to rest.”
Countries in the middle of summer, such as Australia and Brazil, reported dozens of cases of COVID-19. Singapore, where it’s hot and humid most of the year, has confirmed more than 100 cases.
“I think it’s very likely we’re going to continue to see spread over the summer. Now, might the spread slow down a bit? Maybe. But it’s going to be very hard to measure that."
Should governments close schools to slow the spread of the virus?,"School closures, such as the Ontario Government’s decision to cancel classes for elementary and high school students until April 6, can cause significant disruption. But health experts note that temporarily closing classrooms has proved to be one of the most effective tools in curtailing a contagion. “There’s certainly evidence from other respiratory viruses that children are a big incubator of this. And they’re also the ones that are very good at spreading it to other people,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital.

“Based on that evidence, I think most places have thought about closing schools.”

Parents won’t be surprised to hear that children are considered “super spreaders” of respiratory illnesses. But that may prove particularly true in the case of COVID-19, because the vast majority of children’s symptoms thus far have been mild and, as a result, more difficult to detect.

The WHO reported in February that 2.4 per cent of COVID-19 cases involved children and just 0.2 per cent were children who became critically ill."
What should I do if I develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19?,"Symptoms of the new coronavirus include a fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. But if you develop these symptoms, it’s still unlikely that you’re infected with COVID-19.It’s important to recognize that, right now, we’re in respiratory virus season. The symptoms of COVID-19 will be similar to all the symptoms that you’d experience from other respiratory viruses,” explains Alon Vaisman, an infectious disease expert with the University Health Network in Toronto.

“The highest risk individuals are those who’ve travelled recently or been exposed to somebody who is confirmed to be infected.”"
How to protect yourself,"Vaisman notes that most hospitals and community centres in Canada are still only testing those who have recently travelled abroad or had direct exposure to someone diagnosed with COVID-19.“If you’re experiencing respiratory symptoms or fever, you’re most likely explanation is not COVID-19. However, the likelihood of that will change depending on what happens in Canada and whether we start seeing increases in community transmission.”"
What are the chances of dying from COVID-19?,"We still don’t know exactly how deadly this disease is. Globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died, according to the World Health Organisation’s briefing on March 3. But the actual mortality rate may be much lower.“Most of those numbers are coming from Hubei Province, where they were overwhelmed with this. And so their mortality rate is artificially high,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital.

Because symptoms can be mild and many cases are likely going undiagnosed, experts believe the real mortality (or death) rate is closer to one per cent. South Korea, for example, rolled out a mass public testing programme, with as many as 10,000 new tests conducted per day. The mortality rate there has remained below one per cent.

Italy has seen a mortality rate closer to five per cent, but it also has the oldest population in Europe, with about a quarter of its residents aged 65 or older."
Who is most at risk?,"The older you are, the more likely you are to have a rougher course with this infection,” says infectious disease expert Isaac Bogoch.In Italy, for example, the average age of those who have died was 81, according to Italy’s national health institute on March 5. And many of the victims had preexisting health conditions.In China, the official mortality rate was 14.8 per cent in people 80 or older, compared with an overall national mortality rate of 2.3 per cent.

“So it certainly can take its toll on older people. Now, if someone is 80-years-old and they get this infection, is it certain that they are going to die? Of course not. It’s a risk factor.”"
Are children at risk?,"Children can become infected with COVID-19 but appear to carry a much lower risk of developing severe symptoms. Fewer than one per cent of confirmed cases in China were nine years or younger and there were no reported deaths. “It is a bit of a mystery. I don’t think we fully understand why that is the case,” says Vaisman.

“It’s a respiratory infection and people with the most vulnerable lungs tend to be the very youngest and the very oldest. So it is mysterious as to why very young people are not affected the same way that we would see with other viruses.”

While unexplained, it’s also not unusual: children fare better at managing many other infectious diseases, such as chickenpox and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

That said, health officials remain concerned about the potential for children to spread the coronavirus to others, particularly since their symptoms are typically mild and cases can go undiagnosed. “They’re considered a real threat to others because they’re sick, but not that sick. And they can spread it to other people,” says Gardam"
What if I have an underlying medical condition or weakened immune system?,"The answer depends, of course, on the severity of a person’s existing health issue. “Not all underlying medical conditions are created equal,” says Bogoch.“If someone has mild asthma, they may have a bit of a rougher course with this infection, though likely not. But if someone has, for example, really hard-to-manage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), this infection can certainly cause some damage.”

Other underlying conditions associated with severe cases of COVID-19 have included high blood pressure or hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
We have a spring break trip scheduled to California. At what point would you consider cancelling it?,"If you’re wondering whether to cancel travel plans, health officials say your first stop should be the Government of Canada’s travel advisory webpage. Be sure to check the advisories for both your destination and any stopover locations along the way.The website currently recommends avoiding all travel on cruise ships, for example. Vaisman says seniors or those with underlying health conditions might want to reconsider any trip outside the country, including to the United States. “Really think about whether that travel is necessary because they are considered ‘at-risk’.”“If you go out and travel somewhere, even if it’s the United States and you become unwell, how’s that going to affect your family? How’s it going to affect your job? How’s it going to affect your colleagues at work? Because if you do require quarantine, it’s going to have a pretty significant effect on the quality of your life and the people close to you.”

Gardam says he’s personally decided to cancel all travel plans outside of Canada for the foreseeable future. “We’re seeing people’s vacations getting screwed up. I don’t want my vacations screwed up. I have no interest in travelling to someplace and then finding out I have to be in quarantine, or the place I’m staying has been put in lockdown, or my flights have been cancelled or whatever else. I don’t want to deal with that."
I have tickets to a basketball game. Should I cancel those plans and avoid large crowds?,"Health experts are stressing the importance of avoiding large gatherings as an effective means of curtailing the outbreak. “When you increase the likelihood of transmission by having people close together, then you’re potentially going to run into trouble, especially you’re talking about things that are non-essential, like parades or concerts,” says Vaisman. “All it takes is a few individuals who have the virus. All of a sudden you have a few transmission events and then the virus just kind of explodes from there.”The coronavirus is understood to have a “reproductive number” between two and 2.5, meaning each sick person is infecting at least two other people. “So that’s enough to say it’s quick exponential growth,” says Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistical sciences at the University of Toronto. “There’s definitely the potential for there to be a lot more cases because it is quite contagious.”The majority of cases are mild, which has helped to fuel the spread. “That may be why this outbreak has become so severe,” says Bogoch. “Many people who are mildly symptomatic are well enough to leave the house, well enough to travel and therefore transmit to other people. And that perhaps is one of the biggest contributors to this problem.”Canada’s Minister of Health Patty Hajdu said on March 11 that the government anticipates between 30 and 70 per cent of Canada’s population will contract the virus."
Are people contagious before their symptoms appear? How long do symptoms last?,"Once someone contracts COVID-19, it typically takes around four or five days before they start showing symptoms. But they can be contagious before that.“People will probably shed (or spread) the virus for about a day or so before they feel sick,” says Bogoch. “That’s common with all viruses.”

“If you’re an otherwise healthy person, you may find the illness passes after a few days. Although people who are unwell, for example, or who have (underlying health conditions) like diabetes or heart disease, or the elderly, will have a much worse outcome and may experience more severe side effects, such that on around ‘Day 7’ they may require admission to hospital.”"
Do masks protect against the virus?,"Yes and no. If you’re sick, a surgical mask can help prevent you from spreading the virus to others. But if you’re not sick, it’s unlikely to offer much protection.“Walking around the city wearing a mask intermittently? There’s no evidence to say that that’s going to help you,” says Gardam.

“You’d have to be wearing that mask 24/7 to not potentially get infected and never touch it and move it around. And you probably shouldn’t eat either, because you’ve got to take it off when you do that. And you should have eye protection as well. So a mask on its own, it really doesn’t make any sense.”"
Do the pneumonia vaccine or the flu shot protect against the virus?,"The flu shot and the pneumonia (or pneumococcal) vaccine, which is a routine immunization for infants and people 65 and older, won’t protect against COVID-19. But they can help patients avoid contracting those illnesses as a result of weakened immune system from COVID-19. In severe cases, the novel coronvirus may cause pneumonia and lead to respiratory failure."
Should governments close schools to slow the spread of the virus?,"School closures, such as the Ontario Government’s decision to cancel classes for elementary and high school students until April 6, can cause significant disruption. But health experts note that temperately closing classrooms has proved to be one of the most effective tools in curtailing a contagion. “There’s certainly evidence from other respiratory viruses that children are a big incubator of this. And they’re also the ones that are very good at spreading it to other people,” says Michael Gardam, Chief of Staff at Humber River Hospital. 

Parents won’t be surprised to hear that children are considered “super spreaders” of respiratory illnesses. But that may prove particularly true in the case of COVID-19, because the majority of children’s symptoms thus far have been very mild and, as a result, more difficult to detect.

“So based on that evidence, I think most places have thought about closing schools,” Gardam says. 

The WHO reported in February that 2.4 per cent of COVID-19 cases involved children and just 0.2 per cent were children who became critically ill."
"Covid-19 symptoms, when they occur, vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infected","Covid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out"
Is there any way to know whether someone has had Covid-19 in the past?,"Dr William Hillmann: Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available."
Could I have had it and been asymptomatic?,"Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care,It’s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We’re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else."
Are people who are asymptomatic also contagious?,"Hillmann: A significant proportion of people who are totally asymptomatic are contagious for some portion of time. We just don’t know [for how long] at this point, because we don’t have the kind of testing available to screen for asymptomatic infections.When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding."
"Should someone behave differently if they think, but don’t know for certain, that they have already had it?","Dr David Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus."
"If I think I may have had it, do I have an ethical obligation to tell people I came in contact with? Even if it may in fact just have been a cold?","Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every individual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we’re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them."
"If I’ve had it, can I get it again?","Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.There have been reports out of China suggesting people are testing positive for Covid-19 a second time. Most scientists think it is an issue around the inaccuracy of the testing and not that people are having two separate cases of the disease."
What is coronavirus?,Coronaviruses are an extremely common cause of colds and other upper respiratory infections.
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19, short for ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" is the official name given by the World Health Organization to the disease caused by this newly identified coronavirus."
How many people have COVID-19?,"The numbers are changing rapidly.

The most up-to-date information is available from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Johns Hopkins University.

It has spread so rapidly and to so many countries that the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic (a term indicating that it has affected a large population, region, country, or continent)."
Do adults younger than 65 who are otherwise healthy need to worry about COVID-19?,"Yes, they do. Though people younger than 65 are much less likely to die from COVID-19, they can get sick enough from the disease to require hospitalization. According to a report published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in late March, nearly 40% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 between mid-February and mid-March were between the ages of 20 and 54. Drilling further down by age, MMWR reported that 20% of hospitalized patients and 12% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs were between the ages of 20 and 44.

People of any age should take preventive health measures like frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask when going out in public, to help protect themselves and to reduce the chances of spreading the infection to others."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.

For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.

In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures."
Can COVID-19 symptoms worsen rapidly after several days of illness?,"Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of smell, and body ache. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time. Also call the doctor right away if you or a loved one with COVID-19 experience any of the following emergency symptoms: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arouse the person, or bluish lips or face."
One of the symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath. What does that mean?,"Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down.

However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over.

Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem."
Does COVID-19 cause strokes? What about blood clots in other parts of the body?,"Strokes occur when the brain's blood supply is interrupted, usually by a blood clot. Recently, there have been reports of a greater-than-expected number of younger patients being hospitalized for, and sometimes dying from, serious strokes. These strokes are happening in patients who test positive for coronavirus but who do not have any traditional risk factors for stroke. They tend to have no COVID-19 symptoms, or only mild symptoms. The type of stroke occurring in these patients typically occurs in much older patients.

COVID-related strokes occur because of a bodywide increase in blood clot formation, which can damage any organ, not just the brain. A blood clot in the lungs is called pulmonary embolism and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, or death; a blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack; and blood clots in the kidneys can cause kidney damage requiring dialysis.

We don't yet know if the coronavirus itself stimulates blood clots to form, or if they are a result of an overactive immune response to the virus."
Can COVID-19 affect brain function?,"COVID-19 does appear to affect brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.

One study that looked at 214 people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China found that about one-third of those patients had one or more neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms were more common in people with more severe disease.

Neurological symptoms have also been seen in COVID-19 patients in the US and around the world. Some people with neurological symptoms tested positive for COVID-19 but did not have any respiratory symptoms like coughing or difficulty breathing; others experienced both neurological and respiratory symptoms.

Experts do not know how the coronavirus causes neurological symptoms. They may be a direct result of infection or an indirect consequence of inflammation or altered oxygen and carbon dioxide levels caused by the virus.

The CDC has added ""new confusion or inability to rouse"" to its list of emergency warning signs that should prompt you to get immediate medical attention."
Is a lost sense of smell a symptom of COVID-19? What should I do if I lose my sense of smell?,"Increasing evidence suggests that a lost sense of smell, known medically as anosmia, may be a symptom of COVID-19. This is not surprising, because viral infections are a leading cause of loss of sense of smell, and COVID-19 is a caused by a virus. Still, loss of smell might help doctors identify people who do not have other symptoms, but who might be infected with the COVID-19 virus — and who might be unwittingly infecting others.

A statement written by a group of ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported that in Germany, two out of three confirmed COVID-19 cases had a loss of sense of smell; in South Korea, 30% of people with mild symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19 reported anosmia as their main symptom.

On March 22nd, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommended that anosmia be added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms used to screen people for possible testing or self-isolation.

In addition to COVID-19, loss of smell can also result from allergies as well as other viruses, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold. So anosmia alone does not mean you have COVID-19. Studies are being done to get more definitive answers about how common anosmia is in people with COVID-19, at what point after infection loss of smell occurs, and how to distinguish loss of smell caused by COVID-19 from loss of smell caused by allergies, other viruses, or other causes altogether.

Until we know more, tell your doctor right away if you find yourself newly unable to smell. He or she may prompt you to get tested and to self-isolate."
How long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms?,"Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. These findings continue to support the CDC recommendation of self-quarantine and monitoring of symptoms for 14 days post exposure."
How does coronavirus spread?,"The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.

A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public.

Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."
How could contact tracing help slow the spread of COVID-19?,"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.

Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.

The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms."
How deadly is COVID-19?,"The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more total deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19. This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat.

Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at about 1%) is far less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). We will have a more accurate estimate of fatality rate for this coronavirus infection once testing becomes more available.

What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly."
Will warm weather slow or stop the spread of COVID-19?,"Some viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more when the weather is colder. But it is still possible to become sick with these viruses during warmer months.

At this time, we do not know for certain whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather warms up. But a new report suggests that warmer weather may not have much of an impact.

The report, published in early April by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarized research that looked at how well the COVID-19 coronavirus survives in varying temperatures and humidity levels, and whether the spread of this coronavirus may slow in warmer and more humid weather.

The report found that in laboratory settings, higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity decreased survival of the COVID-19 coronavirus. However, studies looking at viral spread in varying climate conditions in the natural environment had inconsistent results.

The researchers concluded that conditions of increased heat and humidity alone may not significantly slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus."
How long can the coronavirus stay airborne? I have read different estimates.,"A study done by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Laboratory of Virology in the Division of Intramural Research in Hamilton, Montana helps to answer this question. The researchers used a nebulizer to blow coronaviruses into the air. They found that infectious viruses could remain in the air for up to three hours. The results of the study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17, 2020."
How long can the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 survive on surfaces?,"A recent study found that the COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.

There's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.

As we learn more, continue to follow the CDC's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.

If surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.

In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces."
Should I accept packages from China?,"There is no reason to suspect that packages from China harbor coronavirus. Remember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu. We don't stop receiving packages from China during their flu season. We should follow that same logic for the virus that causes COVID-19."
Can I catch the coronavirus by eating food handled or prepared by others?,"We are still learning about transmission of the new coronavirus. It's not clear if it can be spread by an infected person through food they have handled or prepared, but if so it would more likely be the exception than the rule.

That said, the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus known to spread by upper respiratory secretions, including airborne droplets after coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in the stool of certain people. So we currently cannot rule out the possibility of the infection being transmitted through food by an infected person who has not thoroughly washed their hands. In the case of hot food, the virus would likely be killed by cooking. This may not be the case with uncooked foods like salads or sandwiches."
"The flu kills more people than COVID-19, at least so far. Why are we so worried about COVID-19? Shouldn't we be more focused on preventing deaths from the flu?","You're right to be concerned about the flu. Fortunately, the same measures that help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus — frequent and thorough handwashing, not touching your face, coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow, avoiding people who are sick, and staying away from people if you're sick — also help to protect against spread of the flu.

If you do get sick with the flu, your doctor can prescribe an antiviral drug that can reduce the severity of your illness and shorten its duration. There are currently no antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19."
Should I get a flu shot?,"While the flu shot won't protect you from developing COVID-19, it's still a good idea. Most people older than six months can and should get the flu vaccine. Doing so reduces the chances of getting seasonal flu. Even if the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms. But again, the flu vaccine will not protect you against this coronavirus."
What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19?,"The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Wash your hands often with soap and water."
What do I need to know about washing my hands effectively?,"Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures."
How does coronavirus spread?,"The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.

Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public.

Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."

Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.

Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.

The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms."
What is social distancing and why is it important?,"The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.

Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.

Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients."
What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home?,"Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.

Medical and health supplies

prescription medications
prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment
fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen
cough and cold medicines
antidiarrheal medication
thermometer
fluids with electrolytes
soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer
tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins
garbage bags."
Should I keep extra food at home? What kind?,"Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms.

canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups
frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat
protein or fruit bars
dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola
peanut butter or nuts
pasta, bread, rice, and other grains
canned beans
chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce
oil for cooking
flour, sugar
crackers
coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices
bottled water
canned or jarred baby food and formula
pet food
household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner."
What precautions can I take when grocery shopping?,"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air. The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food.

Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face.

In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus. Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store. Wash your hands as soon as you get home.

If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, limit trips to the grocery store. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house. See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions. Or have groceries delivered to your home."
What precautions can I take when unpacking my groceries?,"Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus may remain on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours. This means virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. If you need to use the products before 72 hours, consider washing the outside surfaces or wiping them with disinfectant. The contents of sealed containers won't be contaminated.

After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Wipe surfaces on which you placed groceries while unpacking them with household disinfectants.

Thoroughly rinse fruits and vegetables with water before consuming. And wash your hands before consuming any foods that you've recently brought home from the grocery store."
"What should and shouldn't I do during this time to avoid exposure to and spread of this coronavirus? For example, what steps should I take if I need to go shopping for food and staples? What about eating at restaurants, ordering takeout, going to the gym or swimming in a public pool?","The answer to all of the above is that it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately. As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.

If you need to get food, staples, medications or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food as much as possible. If you do order takeout, open the bag, box or containers, then wash your hands. Lift, fork or spoon out the contents into your own dishes. After you dispose of these outside containers, wash your hands again. Most restaurants, gyms and public pools are closed; but even if one is open, now is not the time to go.

Here are some other things to avoid: playdates, parties, sleepovers, having friends or family over for meals or visits, and going to coffee shops — essentially any nonessential activity that involves close contact with others."
What can I do when social distancing?,"Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do.

Though you shouldn't go to the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise. Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside). Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating.

Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play). Avoid public playground structures, which aren't cleaned regularly and can spread the virus.

Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves. Have family movie nights. Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening.

It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person. Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, video, and other social media. Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call.

If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep!"
Should I wear a face mask?,"The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public.

Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in.

A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in NEJM in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.

What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly.

While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.

Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask.

Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.

Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing."
Is it safe to travel by airplane?,"Stay current on travel advisories from regulatory agencies. This is a rapidly changing situation.

Anyone who has a fever and respiratory symptoms should not fly if at all possible. Even if a person has symptoms that feel like just a cold, he or she should wear a mask on an airplane."
Is there a vaccine available?,"No vaccine is available, although scientists will be starting human testing on a vaccine very soon. However, it may be a year or more before we even know if we have a vaccine that works."
Can a person who has had coronavirus get infected again?,"While we don't know the answer yet, most people would likely develop at least short-term immunity to the specific coronavirus that causes COVID-19. However, that immunity could diminish over time and you would still be susceptible to a different coronavirus infection. Or, this particular virus could mutate, just like the influenza virus does each year. Often these mutations change the virus enough to make you susceptible, because your immune system thinks it is an infection that it has never seen before."
Will a pneumococcal vaccine help protect me against coronavirus?,"Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections. They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19. However, even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to protect against other respiratory illnesses."
My husband and I are in our 70s. I'm otherwise healthy. My husband is doing well but does have heart disease and diabetes. My grandkids' school has been closed for the next several weeks. We'd like to help out by watching our grandkids but don't know if that would be safe for us. Can you offer some guidance?,"People who are older and older people with chronic medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease are more likely to have severe disease or death from COVID-19, and should engage in strict social distancing without delay. This is also the case for people or who are immunocompromised because of a condition or treatment that weakens their immune response.

The decision to provide on-site help with your children and grandchildren is a difficult one. If there is an alternative to support their needs without being there, that would be safest."
Can my pet infect me with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At present, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans. However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E. coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with pets."
What can I do to keep my immune system strong?,"Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.

Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:

Don't smoke or vape.
Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.
Exercise regularly.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Control your stress level.
Control your blood pressure.
If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).
Get enough sleep.
Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth."
Should I go to the doctor or dentist for nonurgent appointments?,"During this period of social distancing, it is best to postpone nonurgent appointments with your doctor or dentist. These may include regular well visits or dental cleanings, as well as follow-up appointments to manage chronic conditions if your health has been relatively stable in the recent past. You should also postpone routine screening tests, such as a mammogram or PSA blood test, if you are at average risk of disease. Many doctor's offices have started restricting office visits to urgent matters only, so you may not have a choice in the matter.

As an alternative, doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.

What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results? In these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice."
Should I postpone my elective surgery?,"It's likely that your elective surgery or procedure will be canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure. If not, then during this period of social distancing, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.

That being said, keep in mind that ""elective"" is a relative term. For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc. But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months. In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding."
Who is at highest risk for getting very sick from COVID-19?,"Older people, especially those with underlying medical problems like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart failure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

In addition, several underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age. These include:

blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease, or taking blood thinners
chronic kidney disease
chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis
any condition or treatment that weakens the immune response (cancer, cancer treatment, organ or bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressant medications, HIV or AIDS)
current or recent pregnancy in the last two weeks
diabetes
inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders
heart disease, including coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, and heart failure
lung disease, including asthma, COPD (chronic bronchitis or emphysema)
neurological and neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury."
"I'm older and have a chronic medical condition, which puts me at higher risk for getting seriously ill, or even dying from COVID-19. What can I do to reduce my risk of exposure to the virus?","Anyone 60 years or older is considered to be at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. This is true whether or not you also have an underlying medical condition, although the sickest individuals and most of the deaths have been among people who were both older and had chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems or diabetes.

The CDC suggests the following measures for those who are at higher risk:

Obtain several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others.
When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, and wash your hands often.
Avoid crowds.
Avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed."
"I have a chronic medical condition that puts me at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, even though I'm only in my 30s. What can I do to reduce my risk?","You can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place:

As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.
Maintain enough distance (six feet or more) between yourself and anyone outside your family.
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds.
As best you can, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Stay away from people who are sick.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in your home, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day.
In addition, do your best to keep your condition well-controlled. That means following your doctor's recommendations including taking medications as directed. If possible, get a 90-day supply of your prescription medications and request that they be mailed to you so you don't have to go to the pharmacy to pick them up."
"I have asthma. If I get COVID-19, am I more likely to become seriously ill?","Yes, asthma may increase your risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.

However, you can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place. These include

social distancing
washing your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds
not touching your eyes, nose or mouth
staying away from people who are sick.
In addition, you should continue to take your asthma medicines as prescribed to keep your asthma under control. If you do get sick, follow your asthma action plan and call your doctor."
I'm taking a medication that suppresses my immune system. Should I stop taking it so I have less chance of getting sick from the coronavirus?,"If you contract the virus, your response to it will depend on many factors, only one of which is taking medication that suppresses your immune system. In addition, stopping the medication on your own could cause your underlying condition to get worse. Most importantly, don't make this decision on your own. It's always best not to adjust the dose or stop taking a prescription medication without first talking to the doctor who prescribed the medication."
I heard that certain blood pressure medicines might worsen symptoms of COVID-19. Should I stop taking my medication now just in case I do get infected? Should I stop if I develop symptoms of COVID-19?,"You are referring to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two types of medications used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Doctors also prescribe these medicines for people who have protein in their urine, a common problem in people with diabetes.

At this time, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected.

Here's how this concern got started. Researchers doing animal studies on a different coronavirus (the SARS coronavirus from the early 2000s) found that certain sites on lung cells called ACE-2 receptors appeared to help the SARS virus enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs raised ACE-2 receptor levels in the animals.

Could this mean people taking these drugs are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and are more likely to get pneumonia?

The reality today:

Human studies have not confirmed the findings in animal studies.
Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may reduce lung injury in people with other viral pneumonias. The same might be true of pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus.
Stopping your ACE inhibitor or ARB could actually put you at greater risk of complications from the infection, since it's likely that your blood pressure will rise and heart problems would get worse.
The bottom line: The AHA, ACC, and HFSA strongly recommend continuing to take ACE inhibitor or ARB medications, even if you get sick with COVID-19."
I live with my children and grandchildren. What can I do to reduce the risk of getting sick when caring for my grandchildren?,"In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.

People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.

For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.

In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures."
What should I do if I think I or my child may have a COVID-19 infection?,"First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice.

If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19, contact your local board of health. They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area.

It's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness. Severe symptoms include high or very low body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, or feeling you might pass out. Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming, so they can be prepared for your arrival."
How do I know if I have COVID-19 or the regular flu?,"COVID-19 often causes symptoms similar to those a person with a bad cold or the flu would experience. And like the flu, the symptoms can progress and become life-threatening. Your doctor is more likely to suspect coronavirus if:

you have respiratory symptoms
and
you have been exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19, or
there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area."
How is someone tested for COVID-19?,"A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). New methods of testing that can be done on site will become more available over the next few weeks. These new tests can provide results in as little as 15–45 minutes. Meanwhile, most tests will still be delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test.

Some people are starting to have a blood test to look for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. Because the blood test for antibodies doesn't become positive until after an infected person improves, it is not useful as a diagnostic test at this time. Scientists are using this blood antibody test to identify potential plasma donors. The antibodies can be purified from the plasma and may help some very sick people get better."
What are the differences between the nasal swab and saliva tests for COVID-19?,"Until recently, most tests for COVID-19 required a clinician to insert a long swab into the nose and sometimes down to the throat. In mid-April, the FDA granted emergency approval for a saliva-based test.

The saliva test is easier to perform — spitting into a cup versus submitting to a swab — and more comfortable. Because a person can independently spit into a cup, the saliva test does not require interaction with a healthcare worker. This cuts down on the need for masks, gowns, gloves, and other protective equipment, which has been in short supply.

Both the saliva and swab tests work by detecting genetic material from the coronavirus. Both tests are very specific, meaning that a positive test almost always means that the person is infected with the virus. However, both tests can be negative, even if a person is proven later to be infected (known as a false negative). This is especially true for people who carry the virus but have no symptoms.

Some early reports suggest that the saliva test may have fewer false negatives than the swab test. If verified, home testing could potentially quickly ramp up the widespread testing we desperately need."
How reliable is the test for COVID-19?,"In the US, the most common test for the COVID-19 virus looks for viral RNA in a sample taken with a swab from a person's nose or throat. Tests results may come back in as little as 15–45 minutes for some of the newer on-site tests; with other tests you may wait three to four days for results.

If a test result comes back positive, it is almost certain that the person is infected.

A negative test result is less definite. An infected person could get a so-called ""false negative"" test result if the swab missed the virus, for example, or because of an inadequacy of the test itself. We also don't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive.

If you experience COVID-like symptoms and get a negative test result, there is no reason to repeat the test unless your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms do worsen, call your doctor or local or state healthcare department for guidance on further testing. You should also self-isolate at home. Wear a mask if you have one when interacting with members of your household. And practice social distancing."
What is serologic (antibody) testing for COVID-19? What can it be used for?,"A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.

Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.

However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.

Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.

Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.

Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US."
How soon after I'm infected with the new coronavirus will I start to be contagious?,"The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be three to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure.

We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.

If true, this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing, all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet contagious may unknowingly infect others."
For how long after I am infected will I continue to be contagious? At what point in my illness will I be most contagious?,"People are thought to be most contagious early in the course of their illness, when they are beginning to experience symptoms, especially if they are coughing and sneezing. But people with no symptoms can also spread the coronavirus to other people if they stand too close to them. In fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic, or in the days before they develop symptoms, because they are less likely to be isolating or adopting behaviors designed to prevent spread.

Most people with coronavirus who have symptoms will no longer be contagious by 10 days after symptoms resolve. People who test positive for the virus but never develop symptoms over the following 10 days after testing are probably no longer contagious, but again there are documented exceptions. So some experts are still recommending 14 days of isolation.

One of the main problems with general rules regarding contagion and transmission of this coronavirus is the marked differences in how it behaves in different individuals. That's why everyone needs to wear a mask and keep a physical distance of at least six feet.

Here is a more ""scientific"" way to determine if you are no longer contagious: have two nasal-throat tests or saliva tests 24 hours apart that are both negative for the virus."
"If I get sick with COVID-19, how long until I will feel better?","It depends on how sick you get. Those with mild cases appear to recover within one to two weeks. With severe cases, recovery can take six weeks or more. According to the most recent estimates, about 1% of infected persons will succumb to the disease."
How long after I start to feel better will be it be safe for me to go back out in public again?,"We don't know for certain. Based on the most recent research, people may continue to be infected with the virus and be potentially contagious for many days after they are feeling better. But these results need to be verified. Until then, even after 10 days of complete resolution of your symptoms, you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces, and keeping at least six feet of distance away from other people."
"What's the difference between self-isolation and self-quarantine, and who should consider them?","Self-isolation is voluntary isolation at home by those who have or are likely to have COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms of the disease (in contrast to those who are severely ill and may be isolated in a hospital). The purpose of self-isolation is to prevent spread of infection from an infected person to others who are not infected. If possible, the decision to isolate should be based on physician recommendation. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate.

You should strongly consider self-isolation if you

have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results
have been exposed to the new coronavirus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), whether or not you have been tested.
You may also consider self-isolation if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) but have not had known exposure to the new coronavirus and have not been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19. In this case, it may be reasonable to isolate yourself until your symptoms fully resolve, or until you are able to be tested for COVID-19 and your test comes back negative.

Self-quarantine for 14 days by anyone with a household member who has been infected, whether or not they themselves are infected, is the current recommendation of the White House task force. Otherwise, voluntary quarantine at home by those who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus but are not experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing). The purpose of self-quarantine (as with self-isolation) is to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. When possible, the decision to quarantine should be based on physician recommendation. Self-quarantine is reasonable if you are not experiencing symptoms, but have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus."
What does it really mean to self-isolate or self-quarantine? What should or shouldn't I do?,"If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus, it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover. While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation, you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones. Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections, ask for help, and update others on your condition.

Here's what the CDC recommends to minimize the risk of spreading the infection to others in your home and community.

Stay home except to get medical care

Do not go to work, school, or public areas.
Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor

Call your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office to take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.
Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home

As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask.
Wear a face mask if you are sick

Wear a face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a doctor's office or hospital.
Cover your coughs and sneezes

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in a lined trash can.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after you sneeze. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean your hands often

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Don't share personal household items

Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.
Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces every day

High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.

Clean and disinfect areas that may have any bodily fluids on them.
A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Monitor your symptoms

Monitor yourself for fever by taking your temperature twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.
If you have not had symptoms and you begin to feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, immediately limit contact with others if you have not already done so. Call your doctor or local health department to determine whether you need a medical evaluation.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening, for example if you have difficulty breathing. Before going to a doctor's office or hospital, call your doctor and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.
Put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility or any time you may come into contact with others.
If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive."
What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home?,"Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.

Medical and health supplies

prescription medications
prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment
fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen
cough and cold medicines
antidiarrheal medication
thermometer
fluids with electrolytes
soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer
tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins
garbage bags."
Should I keep extra food at home? What kind?,"Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms.

canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups
frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat
protein or fruit bars
dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola
peanut butter or nuts
pasta, bread, rice, and other grains
canned beans
chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce
oil for cooking
flour, sugar
crackers
coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices
bottled water
canned or jarred baby food and formula
pet food
household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner."
When can I discontinue my self-quarantine?,"While many experts are recommending 14 days of self-quarantine for those who are concerned that they may be infected, the decision to discontinue these measures should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with your doctor and state and local health departments. The decision will be based on the risk of infecting others."
How can I protect myself while caring for someone that may have COVID-19?,"You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:

Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.
Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Extra precautions:
You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.
Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.
Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.
Wash laundry thoroughly.
Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.
Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items."
"My parents are older, which puts them at higher risk for COVID-19, and they don't live nearby. How can I help them if they get sick?","Caring from a distance can be stressful. Start by talking to your parents about what they would need if they were to get sick. Put together a single list of emergency contacts for their (and your) reference, including doctors, family members, neighbors, and friends. Include contact information for their local public health department.

You can also help them to plan ahead. For example, ask your parents to give their neighbors or friends a set of house keys. Have them stock up on prescription and over-the counter medications, health and emergency medical supplies, and nonperishable food and household supplies. Check in regularly by phone, Skype, or however you like to stay in touch."
Can I infect my pet?,"There have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, but the CDC still recommends that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask."
Are kids immune to the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. However, children tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness."
Should parents take babies for initial vaccines right now? What about toddlers and up who are due for vaccines?,"The answer depends on many factors, including what your doctor's office is offering. As with all health care decisions, it comes down to weighing risks and benefits.

Getting early immunizations in for babies and toddlers — especially babies 6 months and younger — has important benefits. It helps to protect them from infections such as pneumococcus and pertussis that can be deadly, at a time when their immune system is vulnerable. At the same time, they could be vulnerable to complications of COVID-19 should their trip to the doctor expose them to the virus.

For children older than 2 years, waiting is probably fine — in most cases. For some children with special conditions, or those who are behind on immunizations, waiting may not be a good idea.

The best thing to do is call your doctor's office. Find out what precautions they are taking to keep children safe, and discuss your particular situation, including not only your child's health situation, but also the prevalence of the virus in your community and whether you have been or might have been exposed. Together, you can make the best decision for your child."
When do you need to bring your child to the doctor during this pandemic?,"Anything that isn't urgent should be postponed until a safer time. This would include checkups for healthy children over 2 years (many practices are postponing checkups even for younger children if they are generally healthy). It would also include follow up appointments for anything that can wait, like a follow-up for ADHD in a child that is doing well socially and academically. Your doctor's office can give you guidance about what can wait — and when to reschedule. Many practices are offering phone or telemedicine visits, and it's remarkable how many things can be addressed that way.

Some things, though, do require an in-person appointment, including:

Illness or injury that could be serious, such as a child with trouble breathing, significant pain, unusual sleepiness, a high fever that won't come down, or a cut that may need stitches or a bone that may be broken. Call your doctor for guidance as to whether you should bring your child to the office or a local emergency room.
Children who are receiving ongoing treatments for a serious medical condition such as cancer, kidney disease, or a rheumatologic disease. These might include chemotherapy, infusions of other medications, dialysis, or transfusions. Your doctor will advise you about any changes in treatments or how they are to be given during the pandemic. Do not skip any appointments unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Checkups for very young children who need vaccines and to have their growth checked. Check with your doctor regarding their current policies and practices.
Checkups and visits for children with certain health conditions. This might include children with breathing problems whose lungs need to be listened to, children who need vaccinations to protect their immune system, children whose blood pressure is too high, children who aren't gaining weight, children who need stitches out or a cast off, or children with abnormal blood tests that need rechecking. If your child is being followed for a medical problem, call your doctor for advice. Together you can figure out when and how your child should be seen.
Bottom line: Talk to your doctor. The decision will depend on a combination of factors including your child's condition, how prevalent the virus is in your community, whether you have had any exposures or possible exposures, what safeguards your doctor has put into place, and how you would get to the doctor."
"With schools closing in many parts of the country, is it okay to have babysitters or child care people in the house given no know exposures or illness in their homes?","The truth is that the fewer people you and your children are exposed to, the better. However, the reality is that not every family will be able to have a parent at home at all times.

All people can do is try to minimize the risk by doing things like:

choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family
limiting the number of babysitters. If you can keep it to one, that's ideal, but if not keep the number as low as possible
making sure that the babysitter understands that he or she needs to practice social distancing, and needs to let you know (and not come to your house!) if he or she feels at all sick or has a known exposure to COVID-19
having the babysitter limit physical interactions and closeness with your children, to the extent that this is possible
making sure that everyone washes their hands frequently throughout the day, especially before eating."
"With social distancing rules in place, libraries, recreational sports and bigger sports events, and other venues parents often take kids to are closing down. Are there any rules of thumb regarding play dates? I don't want my kids parked in front of screens all day.","Ideally, to make social distancing truly effective, there shouldn't be play dates. If you can be reasonably sure that the friend is healthy and has had no contact with anyone who might be sick, then playing with a single friend might be okay, but we can't really be sure if anyone has had contact.

Outdoor play dates, where you can create more physical distance, might be a compromise. Something like going for a bike ride, or a hike, allows you to be together while sharing fewer germs (bringing and using hand sanitizer is still a good idea). You need to have ground rules, though, about distance and touching, and if you don't think it's realistic that your children will follow those rules, then don't do the play date even if it is outdoors.

You can still go for family hikes or bike rides where you're around to enforce social distancing rules. Family soccer games, cornhole, or badminton in the backyard are also fun ways to get outside.

You can also do virtual play dates, using a platform like FaceTime or Skype so children can interact and play without being in the same room."
I live with my children and grandchildren. What can I do to reduce the risk of getting sick when caring for my grandchildren?,"In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time."
What is the University doing about coronavirus?,"The University is acting on advice from sources including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, World Health Organization, the NHS and Public Health England. Our own academic experts in infectious diseases and other relevant subjects are involved in our response to coronavirus. We have taken proactive steps to contact our students and staff to ensure that everyone has access to the latest advice."
Is the University open and operating as normal?,"We understand that staff, students and their families are justifiably concerned about coronavirus. We want to reassure you again that we are following all government guidance. Although the University’s business has largely moved online, education, research and other activities are adapting to the new circumstances.The University has put a number of key measures in place to follow government guidance and keep our community safe:

All non-essential staff members must work from home.
Students have been asked to leave the University unless they have a compelling reason to stay.
All libraries and museums are closed, and there will be no physical access to the collections for researchers or students. However, a wide range of resources are being made available online.
We are encouraging the use of technology for meetings, teaching and learning. New plans are in place for examinations in Trinity term.
We continue to monitor the situation closely, and to provide as much advice, care and support as we can to our University community."
Are University premises (such as libraries and museums) still open to the public?,"In line with government advice, the University's libraries and museums are now closed. However, a wide range of resources are available online. Please contact the relevant library for further details, or visit https://bit.ly/BodleianOnline for more information.

The Botanic Garden, Harcourt Arboretum and Wytham Woods are currently closed. The University Parks remain open; please practise social distancing while using the space."
What can I do to help those who are vulnerable in Oxford?,"We encourage those who are healthy and low-risk to join Oxford Together. Part of the Oxford Hub – a volunteering community created by Oxford University students – you'll find details of the support needed by those who are most vulnerable at this time; including practical activities such as taking out rubbish.

Our thoughts are with those affected by the virus, particularly those experiencing difficulty with small day-to-day tasks. Now is the time for us to support and encourage one another. Further information for staff can be found on our volunteering and community pages."
"
If I have the COVID-19 virus, what can I do to keep from infecting others?","The CDC recommends that people who are actively sick with COVID-19 stay away from others as much as possible. That means separating yourself from others in your home and using a separate bathroom, if possible.

You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing or taxis. If you must be around other people, even at home, you should wear a covering over your nose and mouth.

You should remain isolated until there is no longer a chance you can infect others. The length of time you may be considered actively sick can vary by case, so a decision about leaving isolation should be made in consultation with your doctor."
How can I protect myself from getting COVID-19?,"The CDC recommends these general practices to help prevent spreading viruses:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash your hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty."
Should I wear a mask?,"Wearing a mask can help prevent those who are infected from spreading the virus and offers some protection to the person wearing it. Some public health experts recommend all people wear masks when in public. The CDC recommends the wearing of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies."
Are masks required in the hospital?,"Effective April 3, all health care workers, staff, visitors, and patients will be provided with and asked to wear a procedure mask at designated entrance points."
"If I’m sick and I’m not sure if I have COVID-19, should I go see a doctor?","People who are mildly ill and think they might have COVID-19 can isolate themselves from others at home during their illness. If you feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact a primary care provider, who will assess your symptoms and exposure to determine if a COVID-19 test is appropriate."
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Being quarantined means being separated from people who have been exposed to COVID-19 but who have not had symptoms for the length of the incubation period of the disease. For COVID-19 that period is 14 days from the last date of exposure. Someone who has been released from quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading, according to the CDC."
Is there a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19?,"Not yet. Currently there is no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. However, there are vaccines and drugs currently under investigation. The National Institutes of Health has estimated that a large clinical trial for a vaccine may be available in 12-15 months.

People with COVID-19 should receive care to relieve symptoms. Those with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover through supportive care."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"Symptoms of COVID-19 include mild to severe respiratory illness with sore throat, cough, fever and, for more severe cases, difficulty breathing. Read more about COVID-19 symptoms."
How can I get tested for COVID-19 at Stanford Health Care?,Make a same-day primary care video visit with one of our doctors. Your doctor will then determine if you need to get tested for COVID-19 and help you make an appointment at one of our drive-thru locations throughout the Bay Area.
What should I do if I have symptoms?,"If you feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact a primary care provider, who will assess your symptoms and exposure to determine if a COVID-19 test is appropriate.

If you are having a medical emergency, seek emergency care."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 refers to the human infection caused by the new coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2. While symptoms of many human coronavirus infections are mild, COVID-19 infection symptoms can be serious, leading to pneumonia and in some cases death. COVID-19 is caused by a new virus strain that is believed to have originated around the city of Wuhan, China, and began spreading among people in late 2019."
What is the source of the virus now affecting people?,"It is rare for an animal coronavirus to spread from animals to people, and from people to each other. However, this was the case with both SARS and MERS, and scientists suspect this is what is happening with COVID-19."
How does the virus spread?,"Officials are still learning about how COVID-19 spreads, but the CDC believes it spreads between people in three ways:

From close contact with people who have it.
From respiratory droplets that become airborne when someone, who is infected, sneezes or coughs nearby.
From touching our mouths, noses or eyes after touching a surface that has the virus on it."
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"Researchers are still learning about how easily COVID-19 is transmitted, how severely it will impact communities, and whether seasonal weather changes impact its spread. Some viruses, such as the common cold and flu, spread more during cold months, but it’s unclear whether COVID-19 will behave in the same way."
Where can I find more information about COVID-19?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website is continually updated with information about COVID-19 and includes tips and information about many aspects, including how it spreads, how to stay healthy, whether you should or can travel, and more.
